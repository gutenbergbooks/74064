from the author’s larger work</i> Buddhist
Parables, <i>Yale University Press,
1922. The translation is a close, idiomatic
rendering of the original Pāli text. In a few
cases, words and phrases have been softened,
and sentences have been omitted. In
Story 1, two whole paragraphs which interrupt
the progress of the story have been
omitted. The author has not, however,
“written down” any of the stories in order
to remove such difficulties as the original

</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> quantity of vowels is marked throughout.
Short <i>a</i> is pronounced like <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>, long <i>ā</i> like <i>a</i> in
<i>father</i>, long <i>ī</i> like <i>ee</i> in <i>see</i>, long <i>ū</i> like <i>oo</i> in <i>too</i>,
short <i>i</i> and short <i>u</i> differing from the corresponding
long vowels not in sound but in length. The <i>u</i> in
<i>Buddha</i>, for example, is short. Simple consonants
are pronounced as in English, except that <i>c</i> is pronounced
like <i>ch</i> in <i>church</i>, <i>g</i> as in <i>get</i>, and <i>j</i> as in
<i>judge</i>. Combinations like <i>th</i> and <i>dh</i> should be pronounced
as in <i>hothouse</i> and <i>madhouse</i>. Names containing
underdotted letters have been eliminated. A
syllable is said to be long if it contains either a long
vowel, or a short vowel followed by two consonants
(except a consonant followed by <i>h</i>). Words of three
or more syllables are accented on the second syllable
from the last, provided the next to the last syllable
is short, as <i>Gótama</i>, <i>Mállika</i>. If the next to the last
syllable is long, it receives the accent, as <i>Brahmadátta</i>,
<i>Nibbāna</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE stories are said to have been related
by Gotama Buddha for the purpose of conveying
to his hearers moral and religious
lessons and the lessons of common sense.</p>

<p>Gotama Buddha was born nearly twenty-five
centuries ago in the city of Kapila, in Northeast
India. Kapila was the principal city of the Sakya
tribe, and his father was king of the tribe. <i>Gotama</i>
was his family name. <i>Buddha</i> means <i>Awakened</i> or
<i>Enlightened</i>, that is to say, awakened or enlightened
to the cause and the cure of human suffering.</p>

<p>The Buddhist Scriptures tell us that when Gotama
was born, the angels rejoiced and sang. An
aged wise man inquired: “Why doth the company of
angels rejoice?” They replied: “He that shall become
Buddha is born in the village of the Sakyas
for the welfare and happiness of mankind; therefore
are we joyful and exceeding glad.”</p>

<p>The wise man hastened to the king’s house, and
said: “Where is the child? I, too, wish to see him.”
They showed him the child. When he saw the child,
he rejoiced and was exceeding glad. And he took
him in his arms, and said: “Without an equal is he!
foremost among men!” Then, because he was an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
man, and knew that he was soon to die, he became
sorrowful and wept tears.</p>

<p>Said the Sakyas: “Will any harm come to the
child?” “No,” replied the wise man, “this child shall
one day become Buddha; out of love and pity
for mankind he shall set in motion the Wheel of
Religion; far and wide shall his religion be spread.
But as for me, I have not long to live; before these
things shall come to pass, death will be upon me.
Therefore am I stricken with woe, overwhelmed
with sorrow, afflicted with grief.”</p>

<p>Seven days after Gotama was born, his mother
died, and he was brought up by his aunt and step-mother.
When he was nineteen years old, he married
his own cousin. For ten years he lived a life of ease,
in the enjoyment of all the comforts and luxuries
which riches and high position could give him. When
he was twenty-nine years old, a change came over
him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many centuries, it has been a common belief in
India that when a human being dies, he is at once
born again. If he has lived a good life, he will be
born again on earth as the child of a king or of a
rich man, or in one of the heavens as a god. If he has
lived an evil life, he will be born again as a ghost,
or as an animal, or in some place of torment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>According to this belief, every person has been
born and has lived and died so many times that it
would be impossible to count the number. Indeed,
so far back into the past does this series of lives
extend that it is impossible even to imagine a beginning
of the series. What is more to the point, in each
of these lives every person has endured much suffering
and misery.</p>

<p>Said the Buddha: “In weeping over the death of
sons and daughters and other dear ones, every
person, in the course of his past lives, has shed tears
more abundant than all the water contained in the
four great oceans.”</p>

<p>And again: “The bones left by a single person in
the course of his past lives would form a pile so
huge that were all the mountains to be gathered up
and piled in a heap, that heap of mountains would
appear as nothing beside it.”</p>

<p>And again: “The head of every person has been
cut off so many times in the course of his past lives,
either as a human being or as an animal, as to cause
him to shed blood more abundant than all the water
contained in the four great oceans.”</p>

<p>Nothing more terrible than this can be imagined.
Yet for many centuries it has been a common belief
in India. Wise men taught that there was a way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
escape, a way of salvation. If a person wished to
avoid repeated lives of suffering and misery, he
must leave home and family and friends, become a
monk, and devote himself to fasting, bodily torture,
and meditation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Buddhist Scriptures tell us that when Gotama
was twenty-nine years old, he saw for the first time
an Old Man, a Sick Man, a Dead Man, and a Monk.
The thought that in the course of his past lives he
had endured old age, sickness, and death, times
without number, terrified him, and he resolved to
become a monk.</p>

<p>Leaving home and wife and son, he devoted himself
for six years to fasting, bodily torture, and meditation.
Finally he became convinced that fasting
and bodily torture were not the way of salvation,
and abandoned the struggle. One night he had a
wonderful experience. First he saw the entire course
of his past lives. Next he saw the fate after death of
all living beings. Finally he came to understand the
cause of human suffering and the cure for it.</p>

<p>Thus it was that he became Buddha, the Awakened,
the Enlightened. He saw that the cause of
rebirth and suffering was craving for worldly pleasures
and life and riches. He saw that if this craving
were uprooted, rebirth and suffering would come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
an end. He saw that this craving could be uprooted
by right belief, right living, and meditation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> forty-five years the Buddha journeyed from
place to place, preaching and teaching. He founded
an order of monks and nuns, and won many converts.
He lived to be eighty years old. Missionaries
carried his teachings from India to Ceylon and
Burma and China and Tibet and Japan. In a few
hundred years the religion of the Buddha had spread
over the whole of Asia. Hundreds of millions of
human beings have accepted his teachings.</p>

<p>In at least two respects, the teachings of the
Buddha were quite remarkable. In the first place,
he insisted on the virtue of moderation. He urged
upon his hearers to avoid the two extremes of a life
devoted to fasting and self-torture, and a life of
self-indulgence. In the second place, he taught that
a man must love his neighbor as himself, returning
good for evil and love for hatred. But this was not
all. He taught men to love all living creatures without
respect of kind or person. He taught men not
to injure or kill any living creature, whether a
human being or an animal, even in self-defense. All
war, according to the teaching of the Buddha, is
unholy.</p>

<p>In the course of time it came to be believed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
Gotama had become Buddha as the fruit of good
deeds performed in countless previous states of
existence, especially deeds of generosity. At any
time, had he so desired, he might have uprooted
craving for worldly pleasures and life and riches by
meditation, and thus have escaped the sufferings of
repeated states of existence. But this he deemed an
unworthy course. Out of pity and compassion and
friendliness for living creatures, he preferred to be
reborn again and again, to suffer and to die again
and again, in order that, by the accumulated merit
of good works, he might himself become enlightened
and thus be able to enlighten others.</p>

<p>In comparison with the career of the Future
Buddha, devoted to the performance of good works,
unselfish, generous to the point of sacrificing his
own body and blood,—the career of the monk, isolated
from the world, selfish, seeking by meditation
to uproot craving for worldly pleasures and life and
riches, seemed low and mean. The disciple began to
imitate his Master. Thus began the Higher Career
or Vehicle of Mahāyāna or Catholic Buddhism, as
distinguished from the Lower Career or Vehicle of
the more primitive Hīnayāna Buddhism of the Pāli
texts. Thus did the quest of Buddhahood supplant
the quest of Nibbāna. This development took place
long before the beginning of the Christian era.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span><span class="smcap">Gotama Buddha</span> made frequent use of similes,
allegories, parables, fables, and other stories, to
illustrate his teachings. His example was imitated
by his followers, and in the course of time hundreds
and hundreds of stories were attributed to him on
general principles. Most of these stories were, in
their original form, nothing but simple folk-tales,
many of them of great antiquity. Parallels and
variants are found in the Mahābhārata, the Panchatantra,
Bidpai’s Fables, the Hitopadesha, the
Kathāsaritsāgara, and other fiction-collections,
especially those of the Jains.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-six stories contained in this book,
of eight of which two versions are given, eleven
stories or versions of stories (6, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 <i>a</i>,
18 <i>a</i>, 19 <i>a</i>, 20 <i>a</i>, 23 <i>a</i>, 24 <i>a</i>) are taken from the oldest
canonical texts of the Buddhist Sacred Scriptures.
Of these eleven stories, the first nine are said to have
been related by Gotama himself, the last two being
attributed to the Buddhist sage Kumāra Kassapa.
It is highly probable that the tradition embodied in
the texts regarding these eleven stories is correct.
We may therefore feel quite certain that such remarkable
parables as <i>Brahmadatta and the prince</i>
(6), <i>Blind men and elephant</i> (13), and <i>The birds</i>
(16) were actually related by Gotama himself, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>
substantially the same form as that in which we now
have them. It is not at all unlikely that such a parable
as <i>Brahmadatta and Mallika</i> (8) was also related
by Gotama, but of this we cannot be certain.</p>

<p>The approximate date of these old canonical
texts is now well established. Numerous references
to the Buddhist Scriptures in the Bhābrā edict of
Asoka, about 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and in the canonical work
<i>Kathāvatthu</i>, of about the same date, amply justify
the statement that the texts from which these eleven
stories are taken are, in their present form, at least
three or four centuries anterior to the Christian era.
It may interest the reader to know that these texts,
originating in North India in the lifetime of
Gotama, were handed down by oral tradition for
many generations, were reduced to canonical form
within a century or two of the death of Gotama,
were carried to Ceylon in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
were written down for the first time in the first
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and were copied and recopied on
palm-leaves by successive generations of scribes
until comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>The rest of the stories (except 25 and 26) are
taken from the <i>Book of the Buddha’s Previous Existences</i>
or <i>Jātaka Book</i>. This remarkable work,
which also originated in North India, relates in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
mixed prose and verse the experiences of the Future
Buddha in each of 550 states of existence previous
to his rebirth as Gotama. The received text of this
work represents a recension made in Ceylon early
in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, but much of the material is
demonstrably many centuries older. For example,
the stanzas rank as canonical Scripture, older versions
of some of the stories occur in the canonical
texts, and many of the stories (including 4 and 7
and 22) are illustrated by Bharahat sculptures of
the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Stories 25 and 26 are also
<i>Jātaka</i> tales, adapted from C. H. Tawney’s translation
of the <i>Kathāsaritsāgara</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the most part, the <i>Jātaka</i> stories purport to
relate incidents in Gotama’s previous states of existence
as a human being. For example, as Prince
Noble-heart (1), he triumphs over his enemies and
succeeds to the throne of his father through the
kindly offices of a grateful elephant. As a Brahman’s
son (2), he befriends in turn a pampered
prince, a snake, a rat, and a parrot, with the result
that he is basely betrayed by the prince, but treated
with profound gratitude by the three animals.</p>

<p>As King Brahmadatta (8), he overcomes anger
with kindness, evil with good, the stingy with gifts,
and the liar with truth. As Prince Five-weapons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
(9), he overcomes the giant ogre Sticky-hair with
the Weapon of Knowledge. As a Brahman’s son
(17 <i>b</i>), he frees his younger brother from the power
of Jewel-neck, the dragon-king. As a Brahman’s
son (18 <i>b</i>), he teaches friendliness for all living
beings. As a caravan-leader (24 <i>b</i>), he protects his
companions from a troop of man-eating ogres. As
Jīmūta-vāhana, prince of the fairies (26), he offers
the sacrifice of his body and blood for the welfare
of all living beings.</p>

<p>Several of the stories purport to relate incidents
in Gotama’s previous states of existence as an
animal. For example, as a generous elephant (3),
he gives his tusks to an ungrateful forester who has
betrayed him. As a merciful elephant (4), he spares
the life of a tiny quail. As a wise quail (5), he avoids
the snares of a fowler. As a brave lion (15), he
averts the destruction of a host of frightened animals.
As a wise partridge (19 <i>b</i>), he serves as the
preceptor of a monkey and an elephant. As a wise
quail (20 <i>b</i>), he outwits a hawk. As a wise boar
(25), he offers the sacrifice of his body and blood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> did the Future Buddha come to be identified
with the hero of each of these stories? The stories
themselves give us the answer. For example, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
story of <i>Brahmadatta and the prince</i> (6), we read
that a high-minded prince generously forgave the
murderer of his father and mother, returning good
for evil and love for hatred. In this, the oldest form
of the story, the Future Buddha is not even mentioned.
But in a later form of the story, <i>Jātaka</i> 371,
we are expressly told that the generous prince was
none other than the Future Buddha.</p>

<p>Stories 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, and 24 illustrate the
same process in a very striking way. Of each of these
stories we have two versions, an earlier version from
a canonical source, and a later version from an uncanonical
source. It will be observed that in the
older versions the Future Buddha is not mentioned
at all. But in the later versions he is identified in
turn with a wise ascetic (17 <i>b</i>, 18 <i>b</i>), a wise partridge
(19 <i>b</i>), a wise quail (20 <i>b</i>), an honest dicer
(23 <i>b</i>), and a wise caravan-leader (24 <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>Originally a simple folk-tale, each of these stories
has been converted into a birth-story by the simple
literary device of identifying the highest and
noblest character in the story with the Future
Buddha. This, of course, was a comparatively easy
matter, for the Future Buddha, in his previous
states of existence, was believed to have exhibited
the qualities of wisdom, courage, and generosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
and there are few of the stories in which at least one
of the characters does not exhibit one or another of
these qualities.</p>

<p>The attempt to introduce the Future Buddha
into the stories is not always carried out in a way
to satisfy or convince the reader. Thus, as an honest
dicer (23 <i>b</i>), he violates Buddhist teaching by administering
deadly poison to his companion, a dishonest
dicer. The latter must not, of course, be
allowed to die. The honest dicer is therefore made
to administer an emetic to his companion and to
admonish him. As a wise quail (20 <i>b</i>), he again
violates Buddhist teaching by saving his own life
at the expense of his enemy’s life. Here the inconsistency
is allowed to stand, and the story is used to
illustrate the folly of walking in forbidden ground.</p>

<p>In the case of some of the stories, the figure of the
Future Buddha is, so to speak, lugged in by the
heels. For example, little or nothing is gained by
identifying the antelope caught in a trap (7) with
the Future Buddha. As a Brahman’s pupil (10),
and as a king’s counsellor (14), the Future Buddha
offers only a word of advice. As a trader (21), and
as a wise man (22), he is merely a spectator, and
contents himself with remarking on the folly of misdirected
effort. It is quite clear that in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
these stories also we are dealing with simple folk-tales
which have undergone only slight modification.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the stories have traveled all over the
world. In the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
centuries, many of them found their way into the
highways and byways of European literature. With

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Note on the Illustrations.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> fifty years ago Sir Alexander Cunningham
discovered among the ruins of a memorial mound
or stūpa near the village of Bharahat, 120 miles
southwest of Allahabad, a series of sculptures of
the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, illustrating the legendary life
of the Buddha and stories from the <i>Book of the
Buddha’s Previous Existences</i> or <i>Jātaka Book</i>.
Photographs of these sculptures, together with a
detailed description of each, will be found in the
explorer’s monumental work <i>Stūpa of Bharhut</i>.</p>

<p>It is from these Bharahat sculptures that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</span>
artist has taken most of the materials for the illustrations
to the present volume. From these sculptures
have been taken, not only three entire scenes,
but animals, costumes, trees, plants, fruits, flowers,
and other objects. In the case of two scenes, where
the sculptured objects differ materially from the
objects described in the text, the artist has followed
the sculptures rather than the text. In the matter
of details, the illustrations are believed to be correct
in every particular.</p>

<p>The design which appears on the cover, and again
on the title-page, <i>Elephant and children</i>, is taken
from Cunningham, Plate xxxiii. 2, <i>Elephant and
monkeys</i>. The Bharahat sculpture represents an
elephant being driven along by a troop of monkeys.
The artist has substituted children for monkeys, but
has preserved the spirit of the scene. It may as well
be said here as anywhere else that the saffron yellow
of the cover is the exact color of the robes of a Buddhist
monk. The color is therefore symbolic.</p>

<p>The frontispiece, illustrating Story 1, <i>The grateful
elephant</i>, represents the scene in the elephant-stable.
A pure white elephant is shown in the act of
raising the young prince, the Future Buddha, to
his shoulders. On the right stands the queen, under
a parasol held by an attendant. On the left stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</span>
ministers of state, ladies-in-waiting, and slaves. The
open window, through which the blue sky is seen,
forms an effective panel for the portrait of the
young prince. The saffron yellow of the background
is again symbolic.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 2, <i>Grateful animals and
ungrateful man</i>, represents the pampered prince
astride of a tree-trunk, accompanied by his three
companions, a snake, a rat, and a parrot, swept
along by the river amid storm and darkness.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 3, <i>Elephant and forester</i>,
shows the Future Buddha, in the form of a
pure white elephant, reclining like a cow, and willingly
permitting the ungrateful forester to cut off
his two tusks. Trees.—Left middle: Pātali-tree,
Trumpet Flower, <i>Bignonia Suaveolens</i>, the Bo-tree
of the Buddha Vipassi. See Cunningham,
Plates xxiii. 3 and xxix. 1. Centre over elephant:
Probably the Sāl-tree, <i>Shorea Robusta</i>, the Bo-tree
of the Buddha Vessabhu. The mother of Gotama is
said to have stood upright at his birth and to have
supported herself by a branch of a Sāl-tree. See
Cunningham, Plate xxix. 2 and 5. Over elephant’s
head: Fan-palm, <i>Borassus Flabelliformis</i>. See
Cunningham, Plate xxx. 4. Right middle: Probably
a Sandalwood-tree, Candana. See Cunningham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</span>
Plate lvii. Lower left: Magnolia. See Cunningham,
Plate xxv. 1 (above archer).</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 7, <i>Antelope, woodpecker,
tortoise, and hunter</i>, is taken from Cunningham,
Plate xxvii. 9. As the hunter approaches, the
tortoise releases the antelope from the trap, and
the antelope springs to a place of safety. In drawing
the trap, the artist has followed the sculptured
model, rather than the description in the text. The
tree in the background is the Sirīsa-tree, <i>Acacia
Sirisa</i>, more properly, <i>Albizzia Lebbek</i>, the Bo-tree
of the Buddha Kakusandha. See Cunningham,
Plate xxix. 3.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 9, <i>A Buddhist Tar-baby</i>,
represents the Future Buddha in the person
of Prince Five-weapons casting a spear at the giant
ogre Sticky-hair. The drawing of the ogre follows
closely the description given in the text. The tree in
the background is the Fan-palm, represented in
Cunningham, Plate xxx. 4. The trees to the right
and left are specimens of the Banyan-tree, the
Nyagrodha, <i>Ficus Indica</i>, the Bo-tree of the
Buddha Kassapa. Note the down-growing roots.
See Cunningham, Plates xv. 3, xxvi. 6, xxx. 1 and 2.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 11, <i>The anger-eating
ogre</i>, represents the ogre seated on the Yellowstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</span>
throne of Sakka (Indra), king of the gods, in the
heaven of the Thirty-three gods, thereby arousing
the indignation and anger of the gods, of whom two
are shown in the drawing. The tree in the background
is probably the Sāl-tree. See note on illustration
to Story 3.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 14, <i>King and boar</i>, represents
the boar flying through the air by the magical
power of the gem which he has just bitten. The
power of flying through the air is mentioned in the
oldest texts as one of the several varieties of magical
power which may be acquired by the Practice of
Meditation.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 15, <i>A Buddhist Henny-Penny</i>,
shows the Future Buddha, in the form of a
lion, setting out with the little hare on his back to
discover the cause of the flight of the animals. The
artist has introduced representatives of the various
animals mentioned in the story, and a few monkeys
for good measure. Trees.—Left: Magnolia. See
Cunningham, Plate xxv. 1 (above archer). Centre:
Jack-tree. See Cunningham, Plate xiv. 1 (extreme
left), xli. 4, xlii. 8, and xliii. 1. Top: Udumbara-tree,
<i>Ficus Glomerata</i>, the Bo-tree of the Buddha Kanakamuni.
See Cunningham, Plate xxix. 4. Right
middle: Sirīsa-tree, <i>Acacia Sirisa</i>, more properly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</span>
<i>Albizzia Lebbek</i>, the Bo-tree of the Buddha Kakusandha.
See Cunningham, Plate xiv. 3. In the illustration
to Story 7, the tree is represented in flower.
Compare Cunningham, Plate xxix. 3. Lower right:
Rose-apple, Jambu-tree. See Cunningham, Plate
xliv. 8. India is frequently called the Land of the
Rose-apple.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 17, <i>Dragon Jewel-neck</i>,
represents the king of the dragons encircling the
ascetic with his coils. The ascetic is seated at the door
of his leaf-hut on the bank of the Ganges. The tree
in the background is the Sacred Fig-tree, the Pipphala,
<i>Ficus Religiosa</i>. It was under a tree of this
species that Gotama sat on the night of his Enlightenment.
Accordingly, this tree has a symbolic value
for Buddhists corresponding to that which the
Cross has for Christians, and is frequently sculptured
on the monuments. See Cunningham, Plates
xiii. 1, xxx. 3. The tree to the right of the hut may
be a Sandalwood-tree. See note on illustration to
Story 3.</p>

<p>The illustration to Story 22, <i>Monkey-gardeners</i>,
is taken from Cunningham, Plate xlv. 5. The monkeys,
in obedience to the instructions of their leader,
are pulling up the young fig-trees by the roots,
examining the roots, watering plentifully the trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</span>
with long roots, but sparingly the trees with short
roots, and planting them again. In drawing the
water-pots, the artist has followed the Bharahat

<p class="ph3"><i>Where there’s a will, there’s a way.</i></p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 156: ii. 17-23.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Relying on Noble-heart.</i> This parable was related by the
Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference
to a certain monk who relaxed effort. Said the Teacher to him:
“Of a truth, monk, did you not, in a previous state of existence,
by exerting yourself, get and give to a young prince no bigger
than a piece of meat, dominion over the city of Benāres, a city
twelve leagues in measure?” So saying, he related the following
Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
there was a carpenters’ settlement not far from
Benāres. In this settlement lived five hundred carpenters.
They would go up-stream in a boat, cut
timber for building materials for houses in the
forest, and prepare houses of one or more stories on
the spot. Then, marking all of the timbers, beginning
with the pillars, they would carry them to the
river-bank, load them on a boat, return to the city
with the current, and for a price build for any particular
person any particular kind of house he desired
to have built. Then they would go back to the
forest and get building materials once more. Thus
they made their living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>One day, not far from the camp where they were
fashioning timbers, a certain elephant trod on an
acacia splinter, and the splinter pierced his foot. He
suffered intense pain, and his foot became swollen
and festered. Maddened with pain, hearing the
sound of those carpenters fashioning timbers, thinking
to himself, “With the help of these carpenters I
can get relief,” he went to them on three feet and
lay down not far off. The carpenters saw that his
foot was swollen, and on drawing closer, saw the
splinter in his foot. So making incisions all round
the splinter with a sharp knife, they tied a cord to
the splinter, removed the splinter with a pull, let out
the pus, washed the wound with hot water, and by
applying proper remedies, in no very long time
made the wound comfortable.</p>

<p>When the elephant was well, he thought: “I owe
my life to these carpenters; now I ought to do something
for them.” From that time on he helped the
carpenters remove trees, rolled them over and held
them for the carpenters while they were fashioning
them, brought them their tools, and held the measuring-cord,
taking it by the end and wrapping his
trunk about it. As for the carpenters, when it was
time to eat, each one of them gave the elephant a
morsel of food; thus in all they gave him five hundred
morsels of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Now that elephant had a son, and he was pure
white, a noble son of a noble sire. So the following
thought occurred to the elephant: “I am now old.
I ought therefore to give my son to these carpenters
to help them in their work, and myself go away.”
Without saying a word to the carpenters, he entered
the forest, and leading his son to the carpenters,
said: “This young elephant is my son. You gave me
my life; I give you this elephant by way of paying
the fee which I owe to my physicians. Henceforth he
will work for you.”</p>

<p>Then he admonished his son: “Henceforth you
are to do whatever it was my duty to do.” Having
so said, he gave his son to the carpenters and himself
entered the forest. From that time on the young
elephant obeyed the commands of the carpenters,
was patient of admonition, performed all of the
duties. They fed him also with five hundred morsels
of food. After doing his work, he would descend
into the river and play, and then come back. And the
carpenters’ children used to take hold of him by the
trunk and play with him, both in the water and on
dry land.</p>

<p>The elephant-trainers reported that incident to
the king, remarking: “That noble elephant should
be sought out and brought to you, your majesty.”
The king made haste up the river with boats and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
rafts; with rafts bound up-stream he reached the
place of abode of the carpenters. The young elephant,
playing in the river, on hearing the sound of
the drum, went and stood by the carpenters. The
carpenters went forth to meet the king, and said:
“Your majesty, if you have need of timber, why did
you yourself come? why shouldn’t you have sent
men to get it?” “I didn’t come for timber, I assure
you, but I came for this elephant.” “Take him and
go, your majesty.”</p>

<p>The young elephant would not go. “What, pray,
will you have done, elephant?” “Have the carpenters
paid for my keeping, your majesty.” “Very
well, I will,” said the king. He had a hundred thousand
pieces of money laid near each of the elephant’s
four feet, near his trunk, and near his tail. But for
all that the elephant would not go. When, however,
pairs of cloths had been given to all of the carpenters,
when under-garments had been given to the
carpenters’ wives, and when the proper attentions
had been paid to the children he had played with,
then the elephant turned around, and eyeing the
carpenters and their wives and their children as he
went, accompanied the king.</p>

<p>The king took the elephant, went to the city, and
caused both city and elephant-stable to be adorned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
He caused the elephant to make rightwise circuit of
the city and to be taken into the elephant-stable. He
adorned the elephant with all the adornments,
sprinkled him, made him his riding-animal, elevated
him to the dignity of a friend, gave him half his
kingdom, and had him treated as himself. From the
day when the elephant arrived, the king obtained
complete mastery over all the Land of the Rose-apple.</p>

<p>As time thus went on, the Future Buddha received
a new existence as the child of the chief consort
of that king. But before the child was born, the
king died. Now if the elephant had known that the
king was dead, it would have broken his heart then
and there. So they said not a word to the elephant
about the king’s death, but waited on him just as
if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But when the king of Kosala, who ruled over the
country immediately adjoining, heard that the king
was dead, he reflected: “The kingdom, they say, is
empty;” and came with a large army and surrounded
the city. The citizens closed the gates of
the city and sent the following message to the king
of Kosala: “The chief consort of our king is about
to give birth to a child. The soothsayers have told
us: ‘Seven days hence she will give birth to a son.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
If, on the seventh day, she gives birth to a son, we
will give battle,—not the kingdom. Wait that long.”
“Very well,” said the king in assent. On the seventh
day the queen gave birth to a son. On the day when
he received his name, because, as they said, “He is
born extending a noble heart to the multitude,” they
gave him the name Noble-heart, Alīnacitta.</p>

<p>Now from the day he was born, the citizens
fought with the king of Kosala. But because they
had no man to lead them in battle, the force, large as
it was, gave way little by little in the conflict. Ministers
reported this fact to the queen, saying: “We
fear that if the force continues thus to give way, we
shall lose the battle. But the state elephant, the
king’s friend, does not know that the king is dead,
that his son is born, and that the king of Kosala has
come to fight.” And they asked her: “Shall we let
him know?” “Yes,” said the queen, assenting. She
adorned the boy, laid him in a head-coil of fine cloth,
came down from the terrace, and accompanied by a
retinue of ministers, went to the elephant-stable,
and laid the Future Buddha at the feet of the elephant.
Said she: “Master, your friend is dead. We
didn’t tell you because we were afraid it would break
your heart. Here is the son of your friend. The king
of Kosala has come and has surrounded the city and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
is fighting with your son. The force is giving way.
Do you either kill your son or get and give him the
kingdom.”</p>

<p>Then the elephant with his trunk caressed the
Future Buddha and lifted him up and put him on
his shoulders and cried and wept. Then he lowered
the Future Buddha and laid him in the arms of the
queen, and with the words, “I will capture the king
of Kosala!” went out of the elephant-stable. Then
the ministers clad him with armor and adorned him,
and unlocking the city-gate, went out in his train.</p>

<p>As the elephant went out of the city, he trumpeted
the Heron’s Call, making the multitude tremble and
quake, and frightening them away. He broke down
the stockade, seized the king of Kosala by the top-knot,
and carried him and laid him at the Future
Buddha’s feet. And when men rose to kill him, he
would not let them, but set the king free with the
admonition: “Henceforth be careful; do not presume
on the youth of the prince.”</p>

<p>Thenceforth the Future Buddha had complete
mastery over all the Land of the Rose-apple. No
other adversary dared to stand up against him.
When the Future Buddha was seven years old, he
received the ceremonial sprinkling and became
known as King Noble-heart. He ruled with righteousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and when his life was come to an end, departed,
fulfilling the Path to Heaven.</p>

Supreme Buddha, the following stanza:</p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 78: i. 322-327.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>True is this saying of some men of the world.</i> This parable was
related by the Teacher while he was in residence at Bamboo
Grove with reference to Devadatta’s going about for the purpose
of killing him. For while the Congregation of Monks,
sitting in the Hall of Truth, were discussing Devadatta’s
wickedness, saying, “Brethren, Devadatta knows not the
Teacher’s virtues, but is going about for the sole purpose of
killing him,” the Teacher drew near and asked: “Monks, what
is the subject that engages your attention now as you sit here
all gathered together?” “Such-and-such,” was the reply.
“Monks,” said the Teacher, “not only in his present state of
existence has Devadatta gone about for the purpose of killing
me; in a previous state of existence also he went about for the
purpose of killing me in the very same way.” Then, in response
to a request of the monks, he related the following Story of the
Past:</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Prince Wicked.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres. He
had a son named Prince Wicked, and Prince
Wicked was as tough and hard as a beaten snake.
He never spoke to anybody without either reviling
him or striking him. The result was that both by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
indoor-folk and by outdoor-folk he was disliked and
detested as much as dust lodged in the eye or as a
demon come to eat.</p>

<p>One day, desiring to sport in the water, he went
to the river-bank with a large retinue. At that moment
a great cloud arose. The directions became
dark. He said to his slaves and servants: “Come,
fellows! take me and conduct me to mid-stream and
bathe me and bring me back.” They led him there
and took counsel together, saying: “What can the
king do to us! Let’s kill this wicked fellow right
here!” So saying, they plunged him into the water,
made their way out of the water again, and stood on
the bank.</p>

<p>As the courtiers returned to the king, they reflected:
“In case we are asked, ‘Where is the prince?’
we will say, ‘We have not seen the prince; it must be
that upon seeing a cloud arise he plunged into the
water and went on ahead of us.’” The king asked:
“Where is my son?” “We do not know, your majesty.
A cloud arose. We returned, supposing: ‘He
must have gone on ahead of us.’” The king caused
the gates to be flung open, went to the river-bank,
and caused them to search here and there. “Search!”
said he. Nobody saw the prince.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in the darkness caused by the
cloud, while the god was raining, the prince, swept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
along by the river, seeing a certain tree-trunk,
clambered on it, and sitting astride of it, traveled
along, terrified with the fear of death, lamenting.</p>

<h3><i>Snake, rat, parrot, and man.</i></h3>

<p>Now at that time a resident of Benāres, a certain
treasurer, who had buried forty crores of wealth by
the river-bank, by reason of his craving for that
wealth, had been reborn on top of that wealth as a
snake. Yet another had buried thirty crores of
wealth in that very spot, and by reason of his craving
for that wealth, had been reborn on the spot as
a rat. The water entered their place of abode. They
went out by the very path by which the water came
in, cleft the stream, and went until they reached the
tree-trunk bestridden by the royal prince. Thereupon
one climbed up on one end, the other on the
other, and both lay down right there on top of the
tree-trunk.</p>

<p>Moreover, on the bank of that very river there
was a certain silk-cotton tree, and in it lived a certain
young parrot. That tree also, its roots washed by
the water, fell on top of the river. The young parrot,
unable to make headway by flying while the god was
raining, went and perched on one side of that very
tree-trunk. Thus did those four persons travel
together, swept along by the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Future Buddha befriends animals and man.</i></h3>

<p>Now at that time the Future Buddha was reborn
in the kingdom of Kāsi in the household of a Brahman
of high station. When he reached manhood, he
retired from the world and adopted the life of an
ascetic, and building a leaf-hut at a certain bend in
the river, took up his abode there. At midnight, as
he was walking up and down, he heard the sound of
the profound lamentation of that royal prince.
Thought he: “It is not fitting that that man should
die in sight of an ascetic like me, endowed with
friendliness and compassion. I will pull him out of
the water and grant him the boon of life.” He
calmed the man’s fears with the words, “Fear not!
fear not!” Then, cleaving the stream of water, he
went and laid hold of that tree-trunk by one end,
and pulled it. Powerful as an elephant, endowed
with mighty strength, with a single pull he reached
the bank, and lifting the prince in his arms, set him
ashore.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_012a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_012a.jpg" alt="Thus did those four persons travel together, swept along
by the river.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>Thus did those four persons travel together, swept along
by the river.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Seeing the snake, the rat, and the parrot, he
picked them up also, carried them to his hermitage,
and lighted a fire. “The animals are weaker,”
thought he. So first he warmed the bodies of the
animals; then afterwards he warmed the body of
the royal prince and made him well too. When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
brought food also, he first gave it to those same
animals, and afterwards offered fruits and other
edibles to the prince. Thought the royal prince:
“This false ascetic does not take it into his reckoning
that I am a royal prince, but does honor to
animals.” And he conceived a grudge against the
Future Buddha.</p>

<p>A few days after that, when all four had recovered
their strength and vigor and the river-freshet
had ceased, the snake bowed to the ascetic
and said: “Reverend Sir, it is a great service you
have done me. Now I am no pauper. In such-and-such
a place I have buried forty crores of gold. If
you have need of money, I can give you all that
money. Come to that place and call me out, saying:
‘Longfellow!’” So saying, he departed. Likewise
also the rat addressed the ascetic: “Stand in such-and-such
a place and call me out, saying: ‘Rat!’”
So saying, he departed.</p>

<p>But when the parrot bowed to the ascetic, he said:
“Reverend Sir, I have no money; but if you have
need of ruddy rice,—such-and-such is my place of
abode,—go there and call me out, saying: ‘Parrot!’
I’ll tell my kinsfolk, have them fetch ruddy rice by
the cart-load, and give it to you. That’s what I can
do!” So saying, he departed.</p>

<p>But that other, the man, because it was his custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to betray his friends, said not so much as a word
according to custom. Thought he: “If you come to
me, I’ll kill you!” But he said: “Reverend Sir, when
I am established in my kingdom, be good enough to
come and see me; I’ll furnish you with the Four
Requisites.” So saying, he departed. And in no very
long time after he had gone, he was established in
his kingdom.</p>

<h3><i>Gratefulness of animals.</i></h3>

<p>Thought the Future Buddha: “I’ll just put them
to the test!” First he went to the snake, and standing
not far off, called him out, saying, “Longfellow!”
At the mere word the snake came out,
bowed to the Future Buddha, and said: “Reverend
Sir, in this place are forty crores of gold; carry them
all out and take them with you!” Said the Future
Buddha: “Let be as it is; if occasion arises, I’ll think
about it.” So saying, he let the snake go back.</p>

<p>Then he went to the rat and made a noise. The rat
also behaved just as had the snake. The Future
Buddha let him also go back. Then he went to the
parrot and called him out, saying: “Parrot!” The
parrot also, at the mere word, came down from the
top of the tree, and bowing to the Future Buddha,
asked: “Tell me, Reverend Sir, shall I speak to my
kinsfolk and have them fetch you self-sown rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
from the region of Himavat?” Said the Future
Buddha: “If I have need, I’ll think about it.” So
saying, he let the parrot also go back.</p>

<h3><i>Ungratefulness of man.</i></h3>

<p>“Now,” thought the Future Buddha, “I’ll test
the king!” He went and passed the night in the
king’s garden, and on the following day, having put
on beautiful garments, entered the city on his round
for alms. At that moment that king, that betrayer
of friends, seated on the back of his gloriously
adorned state elephant, accompanied by a large
retinue, was making a rightwise circuit of the city.
Seeing the Future Buddha even from afar, he
thought: “Here’s that false ascetic, come to live
with me and eat his fill! That he may not make
known in the midst of this company the service he
has rendered me, I’ll straightway have his head
cut off!”</p>

<p>He looked at his men. Said they: “What shall we
do, your majesty?” Said the king: “Here’s a false
ascetic, come to ask me for something or other, I
suppose. Without so much as giving that false
ascetic, that bird of evil omen, a chance to look at
me, take that fellow, bind his arms behind his back,
conduct him out of the city, beating him at every
cross-roads, cut off his head in the place of execution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and impale his body on a stake!” “Very well,”
said the king’s men in assent. They bound the Great
Being, guiltless as he was, and started to conduct
him to the place of execution, beating him at every
cross-roads. The Future Buddha, wherever they
beat him, uttered no lament, “Women! men!” but
unperturbed, uttered the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">True is this saying of some men of the world:</div>
<div class="verse">“Driftwood is worth more than some men!”</div>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Native gloss</i>: A stick of wood washed up on dry land is
of some use: it will cook food; it will warm those who are
shivering with the cold; it will remove dangerous objects. But
an ingrate is worse than useless.]</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, wherever they beat him, did he utter this
stanza. Hearing this, wise men who stood by said:
“But, monk, what is the trouble between you and
our king? have you done him some good turn?”
Then the Future Buddha told them the whole
story, saying: “I alone, by pulling this man out of
a mighty flood, have brought suffering upon myself.
I speak as I do because I keep thinking: ‘Alas! I
have not heeded the words of wise men of old!’”</p>

<p>Hearing this, Warriors and Brahmans and
others, residents of the city, became enraged. Said
they: “This king here, this betrayer of friends, has
not the slightest conception of the virtues of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
embodiment of the virtues, this man who has
granted him the boon of his own life! What have we
to gain through him! Capture him!” And rising in
all quarters, they slew him, even as he sat on the back
of the elephant, by hitting him with arrows and
spears and rocks and clubs. And laying hold of his
feet, they dragged him and threw him back of the
moat. And conferring the ceremonial sprinkling on
the Future Buddha, they established him in the
kingdom. The Future Buddha ruled righteously.</p>

<p>Again one day, desiring to test the snake, the rat,
and the parrot, he went with a large retinue to the
place of abode of the snake and called him out,
saying: “Longfellow!” The snake came, bowed to
him, and said: “Here’s your money, master; take
it.” The king entrusted to his ministers wealth
amounting to forty crores of gold. Then he went to
the rat and called him out, saying: “Rat!” The rat
also came, and with a bow handed over to him wealth
amounting to thirty crores. The king entrusted that
also to his ministers. Then he went to the place of
abode of the parrot and called him out, saying:
“Parrot!” The parrot also came, and reverencing
his feet, said: “Master, shall I fetch rice?” Said the
king: “When there is need of rice, you may fetch it;
come, let’s go.”</p>

<p>With the seventy crores of gold, causing those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
three animals also to be carried along, he went to
the city. And ascending to the grand floor of his
magnificent palace, he caused that wealth to be
stored and guarded. For the snake to live in, he
caused a golden tube to be made; for the rat, a
crystal cave; for the parrot, a golden cage. For the
snake and the parrot to eat, he caused every day
sweet parched grain to be given in a vessel of gold
purified with fire; for the rat, grains of perfumed
rice; he gave alms and performed the other works
of merit. Thus those four persons, one and all, dwelt
together in unity and concord all their days, and
when their days were come to an end, passed away
according to their deeds.</p>

<p>Said the Teacher: “Monks, not only in his present state of

<p class="center">Jātaka 72: i. 319-322.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To an ungrateful man.</i> This parable was related by the Teacher
while he was in residence at Bamboo Grove with reference to
Devadatta. The monks, seated in the Hall of Truth, were
saying: “Brethren, Devadatta the ungrateful knows not the
virtues of the Teacher.” The Teacher drew near and asked:
“Monks, what is the subject that engages your attention now,
as you sit here all gathered together?” “Such-and-such,” was
the reply. “Monks,” said the Teacher, “not only in his present
state of existence has Devadatta proved to be ungrateful; in
a previous state of existence also he was ungrateful just the
same. At no time soever has he known my virtues.” Then, in
response to a request of the monks, he related the following
Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was reborn in the region of
Himavat as an elephant. When he was born, he was
pure white, like a mass of silver; moreover his eyes
were like globules of jewels, and from them shone
forth the Five Brightnesses; his mouth was like a
crimson blanket; his trunk was like a rope of silver,
ornamented with spots of ruddy gold; his four feet
were as if rubbed with lac. Thus his person, adorned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
with the Ten Perfections, attained the pinnacle of
beauty.</p>

<p>Now when he reached the age of reason, elephants
from all over Himavat assembled and formed his
retinue. Thus did he make his home in the region of
Himavat, with a retinue of eighty thousand elephants.
After a time, perceiving that there was contamination
in the herd, he isolated himself from the
herd and made his home quite alone in the forest.
Moreover, by reason of his goodness, he became
known as Good King Elephant.</p>

<p>Now a certain resident of Benāres, a forester,
entered the forest, seeking wares whereby to make
his living. Unable to distinguish the directions, he
lost his way, and terrified with the fear of death,
went about with outstretched arms lamenting. The
Future Buddha, hearing those profound lamentations
of his, thought: “I will free this man from his
suffering.” And impelled by compassion, he went to
him.</p>

<p>The instant that man saw the Future Buddha, he
fled in fright. The Future Buddha, seeing him in
flight, halted right where he was. The man, seeing
that the Future Buddha had halted, himself halted.
The Future Buddha came back. The man fled a
second time, but halting when the Future Buddha
halted, thought: “This elephant halts when I flee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and approaches when I halt. He has no desire to do
me harm, but without a doubt desires only to free me
from this suffering.” And summoning up his
courage, he halted.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha approached him and asked:
“Why, Master man, do you go about lamenting?”
“Master, because I couldn’t distinguish the directions,
lost my way, and was afraid of death.” Then
the Future Buddha conducted him to his own place
of abode, and for a few days gladdened him with
fruits and other edibles. Then said the Future
Buddha: “Master man, don’t be afraid: I’ll conduct
you to the path of man.” And seating him on his
back, he proceeded to the path of men.</p>

<p>But that man, that betrayer of friends, even as he
sat on the back of the Future Buddha, thought: “If
anybody asks me, I must be able to tell him where
this elephant lives.” So as he went along, he noted
carefully the landmarks of tree and mountain. Now
the Future Buddha, having conducted that man out
of the forest, set him down on the highway leading
to Benāres, and said to him: “Master man, go by
this road; but as for my place of abode, whether you
are asked or not, say nothing to anybody about
it.” So saying, he took leave of him and went back
to his own place of abode.</p>

<p>Now that man went to Benāres, and in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of his walks came to the street of the ivory-carvers.
And seeing the ivory-carvers making various kinds
of ivory products, he asked: “But, sirs, how much
would you make if you could get the tusk of a real
live elephant?” “What are you saying, sir! The tusk
of a live elephant is far more valuable than the tusk
of a dead elephant.” “Very well! I’ll fetch you the
tusk of a live elephant.” Accordingly, obtaining
provisions for the journey and taking a sharp saw,
he went to the place of abode of the Future Buddha.</p>

<p>When the Future Buddha saw him, he asked:
“For what purpose have you come?” “I, sir, am a
poor man, a pauper, unable to make a living. I
came with this thought in my mind: ‘I will ask you
for a fragment of one of your tusks; if you will give
it to me, I will take it and go and sell it and with the
money it brings make a living.’” “Let be, sir! I’ll
give you tusks, if you have a sharp saw to cut them
off with.” “I brought a saw with me, sir.” “Very
well, sever the tusks with your saw and take them
and go your way.” So saying, the Future Buddha
bowed his knees together and sat down like a cow.
The man actually cut off his two principal tusks!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_022a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022a.jpg" alt="The man actually cut off his two principal tusks!">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>The man actually cut off his two principal tusks!</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Future Buddha, taking those tusks in his
trunk, said: “Master man, not with the thought,
‘These tusks are not dear to me, not pleasing to me,’
do I give you these tusks. But dearer to me than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
these a thousand times,—a hundred thousand times,—are
the Tusks of Omniscience, which avail to the
comprehension of all things. May this gift of tusks
which I here bestow enable me to attain Omniscience!”
So saying, as it were sowing the Seed of
Omniscience, he gave him the pair of tusks.</p>

<p>The man took them and went and sold them.
When the money they brought was gone, he went
to the Future Buddha again and said: “Master, the
money I got by selling you tusks turned out to be
no more than enough to pay off my debts. Give me
the rest of your tusks!” “Very well,” said the Future
Buddha, consenting. And ordering all things precisely
as before, he gave him the rest of his tusks.</p>

<p>Those also did that man sell, and then came back
again. “Master,” said he. “I cannot make a living.
Give me the stumps of your tusks!” “Very well,”
said the Future Buddha, and sat down precisely as
before. That wicked man trod on the Great Being’s
trunk,—that trunk which was like unto a rope of
silver; climbed up on the Great Being’s temples,—those
temples which were like unto the snow-clad
peaks of Kelāsa, with his heel kicking the tips of
the tusks and loosening the flesh; and having
mounted the temples, with a sharp saw severed the
stumps of the tusks, and went his way.</p>

<p>But even as that wicked man receded from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
vision of the Future Buddha, the solid earth, which
extends for a distance of two hundred thousand
leagues and four Inconceivables more, which is able
to endure such mighty burdens as Sineru and
Yugandhara, and all manner of foul-smelling and
repulsive objects,—even the solid earth, as if unable
to endure the wickedness he had piled upon it, burst
asunder and yawned. Instantly from the Great
Waveless Hell flames of fire shot forth, enveloped
that man, that betrayer of friends, wrapping him, as
it were, in a blanket proper for death and laid hold
of him.</p>

<p>When that wicked man thus entered the earth,
the tree-spirit resident in that forest-grove thought:
“An ungrateful man, a man who will betray his
friends, cannot be satisfied, even if he be given the
kingdom of a Universal Monarch.” And making the
forest ring, proclaiming the Truth, the tree-spirit
uttered the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">To an ungrateful man</div>
<div class="verse">Ever looking for an opening</div>
<div class="verse">You may give the whole earth</div>
<div class="verse">And yet not satisfy him.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus did that tree-spirit, making the forest ring,
proclaim the Truth. The Future Buddha, having
remained on earth during the term of life allotted
to him, passed away according to his deeds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Said the Teacher: “Monks, not only in his present state of
existence has Devadatta proved ungrateful; in a previous state
of existence also he was ungrateful just the same.” Having
completed the parable, he identified the personages in the
Birth-story as follows: “At that time the man who betrayed
his friend was Devadatta, the tree-spirit was one of my disciples,
but Good King Elephant was I myself.”</p>

<p>Hearing that the monks of Kosambi were quarreling, the Exalted
One went to them and said: “Enough, monks! No quarreling!
No brawling! No contending! No wrangling!” Then he
said: “Monks, quarrels, brawls, contentions, wrangles,—all
these are unprofitable. For because of a quarrel even a tiny
quail brought about the destruction of a noble elephant.”</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was reborn as an elephant. He
grew up to be a fine big animal, acquired a retinue
of eighty thousand elephants, and becoming the
leader of a herd, made his home in the Himālaya
region. At that time a tiny female quail laid her eggs
in the elephants’ stamping-ground. When the eggs
were hatched, the fledglings broke the shells and
came out. Before their wings had grown and while
they were yet unable to fly, the Great Being came to
that spot with his retinue of eighty thousand elephants
in search of food.</p>

<p>When the tiny quail saw him, she thought: “This
elephant-king will crush my fledglings and kill
them. Well, I will ask of him righteous protection
for the defense of my little ones.” So folding her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
wings and standing before him, she uttered the first
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I salute you, elephant of sixty years,</div>
<div class="verse">Forest-ranger, glorious leader of a herd;</div>
<div class="verse">With my wings I do you homage.</div>
<div class="verse">I am weak: do not kill my little ones.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Said the Great Being: “Do not worry, tiny quail;
I will protect your little ones.” And he stood over
the fledglings, and the eighty thousand elephants
passed by. Then he addressed the tiny quail: “Behind
us comes a single solitary elephant; he will not
obey our command. If you ask him also when he
comes, you may obtain safety for your little ones.”
So saying, he went his way.</p>

<p>The tiny quail went forth to meet the solitary
elephant, did homage to him with her wings, and
uttered the second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I salute you, solitary elephant,</div>
<div class="verse">Forest-ranger, pasturing on mountain and on hill;</div>
<div class="verse">With my wings I do you homage.</div>
<div class="verse">I am weak: do not kill my little ones.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The solitary elephant, hearing her words, uttered
the third stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I will kill your little ones, tiny quail.</div>
<div class="verse">What can you do to me? You are a weakling.</div>
<div class="verse">Even a hundred thousand like you</div>
<div class="verse">Could I crush with my left foot.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>So saying, he pulverized her little ones with his
foot, and went his way trumpeting. The tiny quail
perched on the branch of a tree and thought: “Just
now you go your way trumpeting. In only a few
days you will see what I can do! You do not understand
that the mind is stronger than the body. Ah,
but I will make you understand!” And threatening
him, she uttered the fourth stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For not alway does strength avail;</div>
<div class="verse">For strength is the destruction of a fool.</div>
<div class="verse">Elephant-king, I will do you harm,</div>
<div class="verse">You who killed my little ones since I was weak.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus spoke the tiny quail. For a few days she
ministered to a crow. The crow was pleased and
said: “What can I do for you?” Said the tiny quail:
“Master, there is only one thing I want done. I expect
you to peck out the eyes of that solitary elephant.”
“Very well,” assented the crow. The tiny
quail then ministered to a green fly. The fly also
said, “What can I do for you?” Said the tiny quail:
“When this crow has put out the eyes of the solitary
elephant, I wish you would drop a nit on them.”
“Very well,” assented the fly also. The tiny quail
then ministered to a frog. Said the frog: “What can
I do?” Said the tiny quail: “When this solitary elephant
has gone blind and seeks water to drink, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
please squat on the mountain-top and croak; and
when he has climbed to the top of the mountain,
then please hop down and croak at the bottom. This
is all I expect of you.” The frog also, hearing her
words, assented, saying, “Very well.”</p>

<p>Now one day the crow pecked out both of the
elephant’s eyes, and the fly let a nit drop on them.
The elephant, eaten up by maggots, maddened with
pain, overcome with thirst, wandered about seeking
water to drink. At that moment the frog, squatting
on the mountain-top, let out a croak. The elephant
thought: “There must be water there;” and climbed
the mountain. Then the frog hopped down, and
squatting at the bottom, let out a croak. The elephant
thought: “There must be water there.” And
going to the brink of the precipice, he tumbled and
fell to the foot of the mountain, and met destruction.</p>

<p>When the tiny quail realized that he was dead, she
cried out: “I have seen the back of my enemy!”
And pleased and delighted, she strutted over his
shoulders, and passed away according to her deeds.</p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 33: i. 208-210.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then said the Exalted One to those monks: “Monks, be united;
do not wrangle. For because of a wrangle many thousand quails
lost their lives.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was reborn as a quail, and lived
in the forest with a retinue of many thousand quails.
At that time a certain quail-hunter used to go to the
haunt of the quails and attract them by imitating a
quail’s whistle. When he perceived that they had
assembled, he would throw a net over them and
huddle them all together by trampling the edges.
Then he would fill his basket, go home, and sell
them. Thus he made his living.</p>

<p>Now one day the Future Buddha said to those
quails: “This fowler is bringing our kinsfolk to destruction.
I know a way by which he shall not be able
to catch us. From this time on, the moment he throws
the net over you, let each quail stick his head through
a single mesh, lift the net, and carrying it wherever
you will, let it down on some thorn-brake. This done,
we can escape each through his own mesh.” They all
assented, saying, “Very well!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>When the net was thrown over them on the following
day, they raised the net precisely as the
Future Buddha had told them to, dropped it on a
certain thorn-brake, and themselves escaped from
under. Twilight came on with the fowler still busy
disentangling the net from the brake, and he went
away absolutely empty-handed. On the next day,
and thereafter also, the quails did the very same
thing. The fowler also, busy every moment until
sunset disentangling the net, got nothing, and went
home absolutely empty-handed.</p>

<p>Now his wife got angry and said: “Day after day
you return empty-handed; I suppose there is some
other household outside you have to provide for
too.” Said the fowler: “My dear, there is no other
household I have to provide for. The fact is, these
quails are acting in unison. The moment I throw the
net, they depart with it and drop it on a thorn-brake.
But they will not live in unity forever. Do not
worry. When they fall to wrangling, I will return
with them all and bring a smile to your lips.” And
he recited the following stanza to his wife:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">United, the birds go away with the net;</div>
<div class="verse">But when they fall out, they’ll come into my power.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now after only a few days had passed, one quail,
lighting on the feeding-ground, accidentally trod on
the head of another. The other was offended and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
said: “Who trod on my head?” “I did, but accidentally;
do not be offended.” But the other was
offended just the same. They bandied words and
wrangled with each other, saying, “You alone, I
suppose, lift the net!”</p>

<p>While they wrangled, the Future Buddha
thought: “There is no safety for a wrangler. From
this moment they will not lift the net. Then they will
come to a sorry end. The fowler will get his chance.
It is impossible for me to live in this place.” And
he went elsewhere with his own retinue.</p>

<p>As for the fowler, he came back after a few days,
imitated a quail’s whistle, and when the quails had
assembled, threw the net over them. Then said one
quail: “They say that in the very act of lifting the
net, you lost the down on your head. Now lift!” Said
another: “They say that in the very act of lifting the
net, you lost your wing-feathers. Now lift!”</p>

<p>Even as they said: “You lift!” “You lift!” the
fowler tossed the net. And huddling them all together,
he filled his basket, and went home and
brought a smile to the lips of his wife.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And for the second time the Exalted One said this to those
monks: “Enough, monks! No quarreling! No brawling! No
contending! No wrangling!”</p>

<p>But in spite of this, they paid no attention to his words.
Thereupon the Exalted One related the following Story of
the Past:</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Love your enemies.</i></p>

<p class="center">Vinaya i. 342-349.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times at Benāres, Brahmadatta king of
Kāsi was rich, possessed of great wealth, ample
means of enjoyment, a mighty army, many vehicles,
an extensive kingdom, and well filled treasuries and
storehouses. Dīghīti king of Kosala was poor, possessed
of meagre wealth, scanty means of enjoyment,
a small army, few vehicles, a little kingdom,
and unfilled treasuries and storehouses.</p>

<p>Now Brahmadatta king of Kāsi drew up his fourfold
army and went up against Dīghīti king of
Kosala. And Dīghīti king of Kosala heard: “Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi, they say, has drawn up his
fourfold army, and is come up against me.” Then
to Dīghīti king of Kosala occurred the following
thought: “Brahmadatta king of Kāsi is rich, possessed
of great wealth, ample means of enjoyment,
a mighty army, many vehicles, an extensive kingdom,
and well filled treasuries and storehouses. But
I am poor, possessed of meagre wealth, scanty
means of enjoyment, a small army, few vehicles, a
little kingdom, and unfilled treasuries and storehouses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> 
I am not strong enough to withstand even
a single clash with Brahmadatta king of Kāsi.
Suppose I were merely to countermarch and slip
out of the city!”</p>

<p>Accordingly Dīghīti king of Kosala took his consort,
merely countermarched, and slipped out of
the city. Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi conquered
the army and vehicles and territory and
treasuries and storehouses of Dīghīti king of
Kosala, and took possession. And Dīghīti king of
Kosala with his consort set out for Benāres, and in
due course arrived at Benāres. And there, in a
certain place on the outskirts of Benāres, Dīghīti
king of Kosala resided with his consort, in a potter’s
dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering
ascetic.</p>

<p>Now in no very long time the consort of Dīghīti
king of Kosala was with child. And this was her
craving: She desired at sunrise to see a fourfold
army drawn up, clad in armor, standing in a pleasant
place, and to drink the rinsings of swords. Accordingly
the consort of Dīghīti king of Kosala said this
to Dīghīti king of Kosala: “I am with child, O king.
And this craving has arisen within me: I desire at
sunrise to see a fourfold army drawn up, clad in
armor, standing in a pleasant place, and to drink
the rinsings of swords.” “Whence are we, wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
folk, to obtain a fourfold army drawn up, clad in
armor, standing in a pleasant place, and the rinsings
of swords?” “If, O king, I do not obtain my desire,
I shall die.”</p>

<p>Now at that time the Brahman who was the house-priest
of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi was a friend of
Dīghīti king of Kosala. Accordingly Dīghīti king
of Kosala approached the Brahman who was the
house-priest of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi. And
having approached, he said this to the Brahman who
was the house-priest of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi:
“Sir, your female friend is with child. And this
craving has arisen within her: She desires at sunrise
to see a fourfold army drawn up, clad in armor,
standing in a pleasant place, and to drink the rinsings
of swords.” “Very well, O king, we also will see
the queen.”</p>

<p>Now the consort of Dīghīti king of Kosala approached
the Brahman who was the house-priest of
Brahmadatta king of Kāsi. The Brahman who was
the house-priest of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi saw
the consort of Dīghīti king of Kosala approaching
even from afar. And seeing her, he rose from his
seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one
shoulder only, and bending his joined hands in
reverent salutation before the consort of Dīghīti
king of Kosala, thrice breathed forth the utterance:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
“All hail! A king of Kosala shall be born of thee!
All hail! A king of Kosala shall be born of thee!”
Then he said: “Be not distressed, O queen. You
shall obtain your desire to see at sunrise a fourfold
army drawn up, clad in armor, standing in a pleasant
place, and to drink the rinsings of swords.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Brahman who was the house-priest
of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi approached
Brahmadatta king of Kāsi. And having approached,
he said this to Brahmadatta king of
Kāsi: “Thus, O king, the signs appear: To-morrow
at sunrise let the fourfold army be drawn up, clad
in armor, standing in a pleasant place, and let the
swords be washed.” Accordingly Brahmadatta king
of Kāsi ordered his men: “Do as the Brahman who
is my house-priest has said.” Thus the consort of
Dīghīti king of Kosala obtained her desire to see at
sunrise a fourfold army drawn up, clad in armor,
standing in a pleasant place, and to drink the rinsings
of swords. And when that unborn child had
reached maturity, the consort of Dīghīti king of
Kosala brought forth a son, and they called his
name Dīghāvu. And in no very long time Prince
Dīghāvu reached the age of reason.</p>

<p>Now to Dīghīti king of Kosala occurred the following
thought: “This Brahmadatta king of Kāsi
has done us much injury. He has robbed us of army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and vehicles and territory and treasuries and storehouses.
If he recognizes us, he will cause all three of
us to be put to death. Suppose I were to cause Prince
Dīghāvu to dwell outside of the city!” Accordingly
Dīghīti king of Kosala caused Prince Dīghāvu to
dwell outside of the city. And Prince Dīghāvu,
residing outside of the city, in no very long time acquired
all the arts and crafts.</p>

<p>Now at that time the barber of Dīghīti king of
Kosala resided at the court of Brahmadatta king of
Kāsi. The barber of Dīghīti king of Kosala saw
Dīghīti king of Kosala residing with his consort in
a certain place on the outskirts of Benāres, in a
potter’s dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering
ascetic. When he saw him, he approached
Brahmadatta king of Kāsi. And having approached,
he said this to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi: “O king,
Dīghīti king of Kosala is residing with his consort
in a certain place on the outskirts of Benāres, in a
potter’s dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a
wandering ascetic.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi ordered
his men: “Now then, bring Dīghīti king of Kosala
with his consort before me.” “Yes, your majesty,”
said those men to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi; and in
obedience to his command brought Dīghīti king of
Kosala with his consort before him. Then Brahmadatta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
king of Kāsi ordered his men: “Now then,
take Dīghīti king of Kosala with his consort, bind
their arms tight behind their backs with a stout
rope, shave their heads, and to the loud beating of
a drum lead them about from street to street, from
crossing to crossing, conduct them out of the South
gate, hack their bodies into four pieces south of the
city, and throw the pieces in the four directions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your majesty,” said those men to Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi; and in obedience to his command
took Dīghīti king of Kosala with his consort,
bound their arms tight behind their backs with a
stout rope, shaved their heads, and to the loud beating
of a drum led them about from street to street,
from crossing to crossing.</p>

<p>Now to Prince Dīghāvu occurred the following
thought: “It is a long time since I have seen my
mother and father. Suppose I were to see my mother
and father!” Accordingly Prince Dīghāvu entered
Benāres, and saw his mother and father, their arms
bound tight behind their backs, their heads shaven,
being led about, to the loud beating of a drum, from
street to street, from crossing to crossing. When he
saw this, he approached his mother and father.</p>

<p>Dīghīti king of Kosala saw Prince Dīghāvu approaching
even from afar. When he saw him, he
said this to Prince Dīghāvu: “Dear Dīghāvu, do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
look long! Do not look short! For, dear Dīghāvu,
hatreds are not quenched by hatred. Nay rather,
dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are quenched by love.”</p>

<p>At these words those men said this to Dīghīti king
of Kosala: “This Dīghīti king of Kosala is stark
mad, and talks gibberish. Who is Dīghāvu to him?
To whom did he speak thus: ‘Dear Dīghāvu, do not
look long! Do not look short! For, dear Dīghāvu,
hatreds are not quenched by hatred. Nay rather,
dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are quenched by love’?” “I
am not stark mad, I assure you, nor do I talk
gibberish. However, he that is intelligent will understand
clearly.” For the second and the third time
Dīghīti king of Kosala spoke thus to Prince
Dīghāvu, and those men spoke thus to Dīghīti king
of Kosala.</p>

<p>Then those men led Dīghīti king of Kosala with
his consort about from street to street, from crossing
to crossing, conducted them out of the South gate,
hacked their bodies into four pieces south of the
city, threw the pieces in the four directions, posted
a guard of soldiers, and departed.</p>

<p>Thereupon Prince Dīghāvu entered Benāres,
procured liquor, and gave it to the soldiers to drink.
When they were drunk and had fallen, he gathered
sticks of wood, built a pyre, placed the bodies of his
mother and father on the pyre, lighted it, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
joined hands upraised in reverent salutation thrice
made sunwise circuit of the pyre.</p>

<p>Now at that time Brahmadatta king of Kāsi was
on an upper floor of his splendid palace. And Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi saw Prince Dīghāvu, with
joined hands upraised in reverent salutation, thrice
making sunwise circuit of the pyre. When he saw
this, the following thought occurred to him: “Without
doubt that man is a kinsman or blood-relative
of Dīghīti king of Kosala. Alas, my wretched misfortune,
for no one will tell me the facts!”</p>

<p>Now Prince Dīghāvu went to the forest, wailed
and wept his fill, and wiped his tears away. Then he
entered Benāres, went to the elephant-stable adjoining
the royal palace, and said this to the elephant-trainer:
“Trainer, I wish to learn your art.”
“Very well, young man, learn it.” Accordingly
Prince Dīghāvu rose at night, at time of dawn, and
sang and played the lute with charming voice in the
elephant-stable.</p>

<p>Brahmadatta king of Kāsi heard him as he rose
at night, at time of dawn, and sang and played the
lute with charming voice in the elephant-stable.
Hearing him, he asked his men: “Who was it, pray,
that rose at night, at time of dawn, and sang and
played the lute with charming voice in the elephant-stable?”
“Your majesty, it was a young man, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
pupil of such-and-such an elephant-trainer, who
rose at night, at time of dawn, and sang and played
the lute with charming voice in the elephant-stable.”
“Very well, bring that young man to me.” “Yes,
your majesty,” said those men to Brahmadatta king
of Kāsi; and in obedience to his command brought
Prince Dīghāvu to him.</p>

<p>“Was it you, young man, who rose at night, at
time of dawn, and sang and played the lute with
charming voice in the elephant-stable?” “Yes, your
majesty.” “Very well, young man, sing and play
the lute for me.” “Yes, your majesty,” said Prince
Dīghāvu to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi; and in
obedience to his command, desiring to win his favor,
sang and played the lute with charming voice.</p>

<p>Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi said this
to Prince Dīghāvu: “You, young man, may wait
upon me.” “Yes, your majesty,” said Prince
Dīghāvu to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi, and obeyed
his command. And Prince Dīghāvu rose in advance
of Brahmadatta king of Kāsi, retired after him,
obeyed his every command, conducted himself in a
pleasing manner, spoke in a friendly manner. And
in no very long time Brahmadatta king of Kāsi
appointed Prince Dīghāvu to a highly confidential
position.</p>

<p>Now Brahmadatta king of Kāsi said this to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Prince Dīghāvu: “Now then, young man, harness
the chariot; I wish to go a-hunting.” “Yes, your
majesty,” said Prince Dīghāvu to Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi. And having, in obedience to the king’s
command, harnessed the chariot, he said this to
Brahmadatta king of Kāsi: “Your majesty, the
chariot is harnessed for you; do as you think fit.”
Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi mounted the
chariot; Prince Dīghāvu drove the chariot. In such
wise did he drive the chariot that the army went one
way, the chariot the other.</p>

<p>Now when he had gone a long way, Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi said this to Prince Dīghāvu: “Now
then, young man, unharness the chariot. I am tired:
I wish to lie down.” “Yes, your majesty,” said
Prince Dīghāvu to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi; and
in obedience to his command unharnessed the
chariot and sat down on the ground cross-legged.
And Brahmadatta king of Kāsi lay down, placing
his head in Prince Dīghāvu’s lap. So tired was he
that in the mere fraction of a moment he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Thereupon to Prince Dīghāvu occurred the following
thought: “This Brahmadatta king of Kāsi
has done us much injury. He has robbed us of army
and vehicles and territory and treasuries and storehouses.
And he has killed my mother and father.
This would be the very time for me to satisfy my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
hatred!” And he drew sword from sheath. Then to
Prince Dīghāvu occurred the following thought:
“My father said to me in the hour of death: ‘Dear
Dīghāvu, do not look long! Do not look short! For,
dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are not quenched by hatred.
Nay rather, dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are quenched
by love.’ It is not fitting that I should transgress
the command of my father.” And he returned sword
to sheath. And this happened a second time, and a
third time.</p>

<p>Suddenly Brahmadatta king of Kāsi rose, frightened,
agitated, alarmed, terrified. Thereupon Prince
Dīghāvu said this to Brahmadatta king of Kāsi:
“Why, your majesty, did you rise so suddenly,
frightened, agitated, alarmed, terrified?” “Right
here, young man, Prince Dīghāvu, son of Dīghīti
king of Kosala, fell upon me with his sword in a
dream. Therefore I rose suddenly, frightened, agitated,
alarmed, terrified.”</p>

<p>Then Prince Dīghāvu, stroking the head of Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi with his left hand, and drawing
his sword with his right hand, said this to Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi: “I, your majesty, am Prince
Dīghāvu, son of Dīghīti king of Kosala. You have
done us much injury. You have robbed us of army
and vehicles and territory and treasuries and storehouses.
And you have killed my mother and father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
This would be the very time for me to satisfy my
hatred!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi prostrated
himself on his face at the feet of Prince Dīghāvu,
and said this to Prince Dīghāvu: “Grant me my life,
dear Dīghāvu! Grant me my life, dear Dīghāvu!”
“How have I the power to grant your majesty your
life? Your majesty, however, might grant me my
life.” “Very well, dear Dīghāvu. You grant me my
life, and I will grant you your life.” Then Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi and Prince Dīghāvu granted
each other their lives and shook hands and swore an
oath not to injure each other.</p>

<p>Then Brahmadatta king of Kāsi said this to
Prince Dīghāvu: “Now then, dear Dīghāvu, harness
the chariot; let us be going.” “Yes, your
majesty,” said Prince Dīghāvu to Brahmadatta
king of Kāsi. And having, in obedience to the king’s
command, harnessed the chariot, he said this to
Brahmadatta king of Kāsi: “Your majesty, the
chariot is harnessed for you; do as you think fit.”
Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi mounted the
chariot; Prince Dīghāvu drove the chariot. In such
wise did he drive the chariot that in no very long
time he came up with the army.</p>

<p>Then Brahmadatta king of Kāsi entered Benāres,
caused the ministers of his council to be assembled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and said this: “If, sirs, you were to see Prince
Dīghāvu, son of Dīghīti king of Kosala, what would
you do to him?” Some spoke thus: “We, your
majesty, would cut off his hands.” Others spoke
thus: “We, your majesty, would cut off his feet.”
“We would cut off his hands and feet.” “We would
cut off his ears.” “We would cut off his nose.” “We
would cut off his ears and nose.” “We, your majesty,
would cut off his head.” “Sirs, this is Prince
Dīghāvu, son of Dīghīti king of Kosala; it is not
permissible to do anything to him. He has granted
me my life, and I have granted him his life.”</p>

<p>Then Brahmadatta king of Kāsi said this to Prince
Dīghāvu: “When, dear Dīghāvu, your father said
to you in the hour of death: ‘Dear Dīghāvu, do not
look long! Do not look short! For, dear Dīghāvu,
hatreds are not quenched by hatred. Nay rather,
dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are quenched by love,’ what
did your father mean by that?” “When, your majesty,
my father said to me in the hour of death: ‘Not
long,’ what he meant was: ‘Do not cherish hatred
long.’ This, your majesty, is what my father meant
when he said to me in the hour of death: ‘Not long.’
When, your majesty, my father said to me in the
hour of death: ‘Not short,’ what he meant was: ‘Do
not break with your friends quickly.’ This, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
majesty, is what my father meant when he said to
me in the hour of death: ‘Not short.’</p>

<p>“When, your majesty, my father said to me in
the hour of death: ‘For, dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are
not quenched by hatred. Nay rather, dear Dīghāvu,
hatreds are quenched by love,’ what he meant to
have me understand was this: Your majesty has
killed my mother and father. Were I to deprive
your majesty of life, your majesty’s well-wishers
would deprive me of life, and my well-wishers
would deprive yours of life. Thus that hatred would
not be quenched by hatred. But as matters stand,
your majesty has granted me my life, and I have
granted your majesty his life. Thus hatred has been
quenched by love. This, your majesty, is what my
father meant when he said to me in the hour of
death: ‘For, dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are not quenched
by hatred. Nay rather, dear Dīghāvu, hatreds are
quenched by love.’”</p>

<p>Thereupon Brahmadatta king of Kāsi exclaimed:
“O how wonderful, O how marvelous, that this
Prince Dīghāvu should understand in its fulness a
matter which his father expressed so briefly!” And
he restored to him the army and vehicles and territory
and treasuries and storehouses of his fathers,
and gave him his daughter in marriage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“For, monks, of these kings who took the rod, who took

How much more, monks, should you, who have retired
from the world under a Doctrine and Discipline so well taught,
let your light so shine in this world as to be known of men as
patient and gentle.” And for the third time the Exalted One
said this to those monks: “Enough, monks! No quarreling!
No brawling! No contending! No wrangling!”</p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 206: ii. 152-155.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion the Teacher related the following story:</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was an antelope and made his
home in a certain thicket in a forest, not far from a
certain lake. Not far from that same lake, on the
tip of a certain tree, perched a woodpecker. Moreover
in the lake a tortoise made his home. Thus did
those three live together as friends, kindly affectionate
one towards another.</p>

<p>Now a certain hunter, on his way through the
forest, seeing the tracks of the Future Buddha at
the place where the animals went to drink, set a
trap, resembling an iron foot-chain, only made of
leathern strips, and went his way. In the very first
watch of the night the Future Buddha, coming to
drink of the water, became entangled in the trap
and cried the cry of a captured animal.</p>

<p>When he made that sound, from the tip of the
tree came the woodpecker and out of the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
came the tortoise. And they took counsel together,
saying: “What’s to be done now?” Then said the
woodpecker, addressing the tortoise: “Master, you
have teeth; you saw this trap in two. I’ll go and
manage things in such a way that that hunter sha’n’t
come near. Thus, if the two of us do our very best,
our friend will save his life.” And explaining this
matter, he uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Come, tortoise! use your teeth, and cut the leathern trap!</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll manage things in such a way the hunter shall not come!</div>
</div></div>

<p>The tortoise began to chew the strips of leather.
The woodpecker went to the village where the
hunter lived. At the first signs of dawn, the hunter
took his knife and started to leave the house. The
bird, observing that he was leaving the house,
shrieked, flapped his wings, and struck him in the
face just as he was coming out of the front door.
Thought the hunter: “I have been struck by a bird
of evil omen.” So he went back, lay down for a little
while, and then got up again and took his knife.</p>

<p>The bird knew: “This fellow first came out of
the front door. This time he will come out of the
back door.” So he went and perched back of the
house. As for the hunter, he thought: “When I went
out of the front door, I saw a bird of evil omen. This
time I will go out of the back door.” So he went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of the back door. Again the bird shrieked, flew at
him, and struck him in the face. The hunter, struck
once again by that bird of evil omen, made up his
mind: “That bird will not permit me to go out.” So
he went back, lay down until the dawn came up, and
when it was dawn, took his knife and went out. The
bird went quickly and told the Future Buddha:
“The hunter is coming!”</p>

<p>At that moment the tortoise had chewed all of
the strips except just one strap. But his teeth had
got to the point where they were ready to drop, and
his jaws were smeared with blood. The Future
Buddha saw the hunter, knife in hand, coming on
with lightning-speed. Rending that strap, he entered
the wood. The bird perched on the tip of the tree.
But the tortoise was so weak that he continued to lie
right there. The hunter threw the tortoise into a sack
and hung the sack on some stump or other.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_050a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_050a.jpg" alt="At that moment the tortoise had chewed all of the strips
except just one strap.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>At that moment the tortoise had chewed all of the strips
except just one strap.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Future Buddha came back, looked about,
and perceived that the tortoise had been taken captive.
“I will grant my friend the boon of life!” he
resolved. So feigning weakness, he showed himself
to the hunter. “That antelope must be very weak,”
thought the hunter: “I will kill him.” And knife in
hand, he started after him. The Future Buddha,
keeping not too far away and not too near, led him
on and entered the forest. When he thought he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>gone far enough, he disguised his tracks, went by
another path with the speed of the wind, lifted the
sack on his horn, flung it on the ground, broke it
open, and let out the tortoise. As for the woodpecker,
he came down from the tree.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha, admonishing his two
friends, said: “I, through you, have obtained my
life. You have done for me what a friend should do
for a friend. At any moment the hunter may come
and catch you. Therefore, Master woodpecker, do
you take your fledglings and go elsewhere; and do
you, Master tortoise, enter the water.” They did so.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Teacher, as Supreme Buddha, uttered the second
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The tortoise entered the water,</div>
<div class="verse">The antelope entered the wood,</div>
<div class="verse">The woodpecker from that dangerous path</div>
<div class="verse">Took his fledglings far away.</div>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>When the hunter returned to that spot and saw
nothing at all, he took the tattered sack and went
to his own house in deep dejection. As for those
three friends, they lived all their lives long with
never a break in their friendly relations, and then
passed away according to their deeds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>8. Brahmadatta and Mallika.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Overcome evil with good.</i></p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 151: ii. 1-5.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion king Pasenadi Kosala, after deciding
litigations in the Hall of Justice, came hastily to pay his
respects to the Teacher. Said the Teacher: “Great king, to
decide litigations righteously and justly is a good thing. It
is the Path to Heaven. But this is no remarkable thing, that
you, receiving admonition from an Omniscient Buddha like
me, should decide litigations righteously and justly. This alone
is remarkable, that kings of old, listening to the words of men
who were wise but not omniscient, decided litigations righteously
and justly, avoided the Four Evil Courses, kept inviolate
the Ten Royal Virtues, ruled justly, and departed fulfilling
the Path to Heaven.” Then, in response to a request of
the king, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha received a new existence as the
child of his chief consort. On his name-day he was
given the name Prince Brahmadatta. In due time
he grew up. When he was sixteen years old, he went
to Takkasilā, acquired proficiency in all the arts and
crafts, and on the death of his father, became established
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>He ruled righteously and justly. He avoided the
Four Evil Courses in rendering judgments. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
he himself ruled so righteously, the ministers of justice
also transacted their affairs with an eye to righteousness
alone. Since the ministers of justice
transacted their affairs righteously, there were no
men who brought dishonest litigations. For lack of
them, hubbub over litigations in the king’s courtyard
ceased. Every day ministers of justice took
their seats in the place of litigation, but seeing no
one come for litigation, departed. The place of litigation
became abandoned.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha thought: “Since I have been
ruling righteously, no men at all have come for
litigation, the hubbub has ceased, the place of litigation
has become abandoned. The time has come for
me to find out whether I have any fault. If I know,
‘This, for example, is a fault in me,’ I will get rid
of it and have to do with good qualities only.” From
that time on he mingled with indoor-folk and tested
them with the question, “Is there anybody who says
I have a fault?” He met with no one who said he
had a fault, but heard mentioned only his own good
qualities. “It may be because these people are afraid
of me that they refrain from mentioning faults in
me and speak only of my good qualities.”</p>

<p>He tested the outdoor-folk, but among them also
met no one. He tested those who dwelt within the
city. He took his stand in the settlements at the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
gates and tested those who dwelt without the city.
Among them also he met with no one who said he
had a fault, but heard mentioned only his good
qualities. “I will test the countryside,” thought he.
So turning over the kingdom to his ministers, he
mounted his chariot, departed from the city in disguise,
accompanied only by his charioteer, and went
as far as the frontier testing the countryside. Meeting
with no one who said he had a fault, but hearing
mentioned only his good qualities, he turned back
from the frontier and started back for the city on
the highway.</p>

<p>Now at this time a king of Kosala named Mallika,
a righteous ruler, was also trying to find out whether
he had any faults. Meeting with no one among either
indoor-folk or others who said he had a fault, but
hearing mentioned only his own good qualities, he
went to that region testing the countryside. Both
kings met face to face in a single wagon-track leading
through a swamp. There was no room for either
chariot to turn out.</p>

<p>Now King Mallika’s charioteer said to the charioteer
of the king of Benāres: “Get your chariot out
of the way!” Said the charioteer of the King of
Benāres: “Master charioteer, get your chariot out
of the way! In this chariot sits the lord of the realm
of Benāres, the mighty king Brahmadatta!” Retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
King Mallika’s charioteer: “Master charioteer,
in this chariot sits the lord of the realm of
Kosala, the mighty king Mallika! Get your chariot
out of the way! Make room for the chariot of our
king!” Thought the charioteer of the king of
Benāres: “He also is every inch a king, to be sure.
What’s to be done?” He came to the conclusion:
“This is the way: I will find out the ages of the two
kings and cause the chariot of the younger to turn
out and make room for the chariot of the older.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the charioteer of the king of Benāres
asked the other charioteer the age of the king of
Kosala. Comparing the ages of the two kings, he
discovered that both kings were of exactly the same
age. He then made inquiry regarding the extent of
his kingdom, his army, his wealth, his reputation,
and his position in respect of caste, race, and family.
He discovered: “Both are lords of kingdoms three
hundred leagues in extent; they are equals as regards
army, wealth, and reputation; they are in the
same position in respect of caste, race, and family.”
Then he thought: “I will make room for that king
who is more advanced in the practice of morality.”
Accordingly the charioteer of the king of Benāres
asked the charioteer of the king of Kosala: “What
is your king’s practice of morality like?” The charioteer
of the king of Kosala replied: “Such-and-such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
is our king’s practice of morality.” And proclaiming,
as though they were good qualities, only the
faults of his own king, he uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Firmness he flings in the face of the firm;</div>
<div class="verse">Mallika overcomes kindly with kindness,</div>
<div class="verse">Good with good, evil with evil.</div>
<div class="verse">Such is this king. Charioteer, turn out of the road.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But the charioteer of the king of Benāres said
to him: “What! Are these the good qualities of
your own king which you have just recited?” “Yes.”
“Well! If these are his good qualities, what must his
faults be like? Now then, listen.” So saying, the
charioteer of the king of Benāres uttered the second
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He overcomes anger with kindness,</div>
<div class="verse">He overcomes evil with good,</div>
<div class="verse">The stingy with gifts, the liar with truth.</div>
<div class="verse">Such is this king. Charioteer, turn out of the road.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hearing these words, King Mallika and his charioteer
both got down from the chariot, unharnessed
the horses, removed the chariot, and gave the road
to the king of Benāres.</p>

<p>The king of Benāres admonished King Mallika,
saying: “Thus and so must one do.” Having so said,
he went to Benāres, gave alms and performed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
other works of merit, and when his term of life was
come to an end, fulfilled the Path to Heaven.</p>

<p>As for King Mallika, he accepted the admonition
of the king of Benāres, tested the countryside, met
with no one who said he had a fault, and went to his
own city. Having given alms and having performed
the other works of merit, when his term of life was
come to an end, he also fulfilled the Path to Heaven.</p>

<p><i>The man whose heart clings not.</i> This parable was related by
the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference
to a monk who relaxed effort. For, addressing that monk,
the Teacher asked: “Monk, is it true, as they allege, that you
have relaxed effort?” “True, Exalted One!” “Monk,” said the
Teacher, “in former times wise men exerted themselves on an
occasion when it was necessary for them to exert themselves,
and by so doing attained the glory of dominion.” So saying,
he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha received a new existence as the
child of the chief consort of that king. On the day
when he received his name, his parents, after delighting
eight hundred Brahmans with all of the Pleasures
of Sense, inquired regarding the signs. The
Brahmans, skilled in the discernment of signs as
they were, seeing that he possessed the signs of a
Great Man, made the following prediction: “Great
king, the prince possesses merit; upon your decease
he will attain the sovereignty; he will become the
foremost man in the Land of the Rose-apple, and
will be celebrated, will be renowned, for his deeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
with the five weapons.” His parents, hearing these
words of the Brahmans, in selecting a name for the
prince, gave him the name Prince Five-weapons.</p>

<p>Now when he reached the age of discretion, when
he was about sixteen years of age, the king addressed
him. “Son,” said the king, “acquire the arts
and crafts.” “Under what teacher shall I acquire
them, your majesty?” “Son, go acquire them under
a world-renowned teacher who resides in the city of
Takkasilā in the kingdom of Gandhāra; here is the
fee for you to give to this teacher.” So saying, he
gave him a thousand pieces of money and sent him
on his way.</p>

<p>The prince went there and acquired the arts and
crafts. Having so done, he took the five weapons
which his teacher gave him, bowed to his teacher,
departed from the city of Takkasilā, and girded
with the five weapons, struck into the road leading
to Benāres. On the way he came to a certain forest
infested by an ogre named Sticky-hair. Now at the
mouth of the forest men who saw him tried to dissuade
him from entering, saying: “Sir prince, do
not enter this forest; an ogre named Sticky-hair
lives here; he kills every man he sees.”</p>

<p>The Future Buddha, confident of himself, fearless
as a maned lion, entered the forest just the
same. When he reached the heart of that forest, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
ogre showed himself to the Future Buddha. He had
increased his stature to the height of a palm-tree;
he had created for himself a head as big as a summer-house
with bell-shaped pinnacle, eyes as big as alms-bowls,
two tusks as big as giant bulbs or buds; he
had the beak of a hawk; his belly was covered with
blotches; his hands and feet were dark green.</p>

<p>Having shown himself to the Future Buddha, he
said: “Where are you going? halt! you are my
prey!” But the Future Buddha said to him: “Ogre,
I knew what I was about when I entered this forest.
You would do well to be careful about attacking me,
for with an arrow steeped in poison will I pierce
your flesh and fell you on the spot!” Having thus
threatened him, the Future Buddha fitted to his
bow an arrow steeped in deadly poison and let fly.</p>

<p>It stuck right to the ogre’s hair. Then he let fly,
one after another, fifty arrows. All stuck right to
the ogre’s hair. The ogre shook off every one of
those arrows, letting them fall right at his feet,
and approached the Future Buddha. The Future
Buddha threatened him once more, and drawing his
sword, smote him with it. The sword, thirty-three
inches long, stuck right to the ogre’s hair. Then he
hit him with a spear. That also stuck right to his
hair. Perceiving that the spear had stuck, he smote
him with a club. That also stuck right to his hair.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_060a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_060a.jpg" alt="Then he hit him with a spear.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>Then he hit him with a spear.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Perceiving that the club had stuck, he said:
“Master ogre, you have never heard of me before.
I am Prince Five-weapons. When I entered this
forest infested by you, I took no account of bows
and such-like weapons; when I entered this forest,
I took account only of myself. Now I am going to
beat you and pound you into powder and dust!”
Having thus made known his determination, with a
yell he struck the ogre with his right hand. His hand
stuck right to the ogre’s hair. He struck him with
his left hand. That also stuck. He struck him with
his right foot. That also stuck. He struck him with
his left foot. That also stuck. Thought he: “I will
beat you with my head and pound you into powder
and dust!” He struck him with his head. That also
stuck right to the ogre’s hair.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha, snared five times, stuck fast
in five places, dangled from the ogre’s body. But for
all that, he was unafraid, undaunted. As for the
ogre, he thought: “This is some lion of a man, some
man of noble birth,—no mere man! For although
he has been caught by an ogre like me, he appears
neither to tremble nor to quake! In all the time I
have harried this road, I have never seen a single
man to match him! Why, pray, is he not afraid?”
Not daring to eat him, he asked: “Youth, why are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
you not afraid? why are you not terrified with the
fear of death?”</p>

<p>“Ogre, why should I be afraid? for in one state
of existence one death is absolutely certain. What’s
more, I have in my belly a thunderbolt for weapon.
If you eat me, you will not be able to digest that
weapon. It will tear your insides into tatters and
fragments and will kill you. In that case we’ll both
perish. That’s why I’m not afraid!” (In these
terms, we are told, the Future Buddha referred to
the Weapon of Knowledge within himself.)</p>

<p>Hearing this, the ogre thought: “What this youth
says is true, every word of it. From the body of this
lion of a man, my stomach would not be able to digest
a fragment of flesh even so small as a kidney
bean. I’ll let him go!” Terrified with the fear of
death, he let the Future Buddha go, saying:
“Youth, you’re a lion of a man! I’ll not eat your
flesh. Do you, this moment released from my hand,
even as the moon is released from the Jaws of Rāhu,
go gladden the circle of your kinsfolk and well-wishers!”</p>

<p>Then said the Future Buddha to the ogre: “Ogre,
I’ll go presently. But you, because in a former state
of existence also you wrought evil, have been reborn
as an ogre, cruel, red-handed, feeding on the flesh
and blood of others. If in this state of existence also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
so long as you live, you do evil deeds, you will go
from darkness to darkness. But from the moment
you saw me, it has been impossible for you to do
evil deeds. Such a crime as taking the life of living
beings means rebirth in hell, in the animal kingdom,
in the region of the fathers, in the world of the fallen
deities; should you be reborn in the world of men,
you will live but a short time and soon pass away.”</p>

<p>In such wise did the Future Buddha recite the
disadvantages of doing deeds contrary to the Precepts,
and the advantages of keeping the Five Precepts.
With one reason after another he terrified
the ogre, preached the Doctrine to him, subdued
him, made him self-denying. Having established
him in the Five Precepts, he bade him practice
them. Then he transformed him into a spirit entitled
to receive offerings in the forest, and having admonished
him to be heedful, departed from the
forest. At the mouth of the forest he told his story
to human beings. Then, girded with the five
weapons, he went to Benāres and visited his mother
and father. After a time becoming established in the
kingdom, he ruled righteously, gave alms and performed
the other works of merit, and passed away
according to his deeds.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Cupidity is the root of ruin.</i></p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 48: i. 252-256.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Whoever seeks advantage by wrong means.</i> This was said by
the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference
to a disobedient monk. For to this monk the Teacher said:
“Monk, not only in your present state of existence are you
disobedient, but in a previous state of existence also you were
just as disobedient. And through this same habit of disobedience,
because you disregarded the words of wise men,
you were cleft in twain with a sharp sword and left lying on
the road. And through your own fault, and yours alone, a
thousand men met destruction.” So saying, he related the following
Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
there lived in a certain little village a certain Brahman
who knew a charm called the Vedabbha charm.
This charm, we are told, was beyond price, of great
worth. When the moon was in conjunction with a
certain constellation, the Brahman would look up at
the sky and recite that charm, and straightway the
Rain of the Seven Jewels would rain from the sky.</p>

<p>At that time the Future Buddha was learning the
arts and crafts in the house of that Brahman. Now
one day the Brahman, accompanied by the Future
Buddha, departed from his own village and set out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
for the kingdom of Cetiya on some business or other.
Along the road, at a certain place in the forest, five
hundred Despatcher-thieves were in the habit of
committing outrages on travelers. They captured
both the Future Buddha and Brahman Vedabbha.</p>

<p>(But why were these thieves called <i>Despatcher-thieves</i>?
We are told that whenever they captured
two persons, they would <i>despatch</i> one of them to
fetch ransom-money; therefore they were appropriately
called <i>Despatcher-thieves</i>. For example,
if they captured father and son, they would say to
the father: “Fetch us ransom-money first; then you
may take your son and go.” Similarly, if they captured
mother and daughter, they would despatch
the mother; if they captured an older and a younger
brother, they would despatch the older; if they captured
teacher and pupil, they would despatch the
pupil.)</p>

<p>So it was on this occasion. Having captured the
Brahman Vedabbha, they despatched the Future
Buddha. The Future Buddha bowed to his teacher
and said: “I will return in the course of a day or
two. Have no fear. However, do as I tell you.
To-day will occur the conjunction of the moon
which causes the Rain of Riches. Under no circumstances,
because you cannot endure your misfortune,
must you recite the charm and cause the Rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of Riches. If you do so, you will yourself come to
ruin, and these five hundred thieves likewise.”
Having thus admonished his teacher, he went for
the ransom-money.</p>

<p>When the sun had set, the thieves bound the
Brahman and laid him down. At that very moment,
from the eastern quarter rose the disk of the full
moon. The Brahman surveyed the constellations
and reflected: “The conjunction of the moon which
causes the Rain of Riches is at hand. Why should
I endure misfortune? I will recite the charm, cause
the Rain of Riches, give the riches to the thieves,
and go where I please.”</p>

<p>Accordingly he addressed the thieves: “Well,
thieves, for what purpose did you capture me?”
“For ransom-money, noble sir.” “If you want ransom-money,
quickly free me from my bonds, bathe
my head, clothe me with new garments, perfume me
with scents, deck me with flowers, and set me on
my feet.” The thieves, hearing his words, did so.
The Brahman, noting the conjunction of the
moon, recited the charm and looked up at the sky.
Straightway jewels fell from the sky.</p>

<p>The thieves gathered up that wealth, wrapped it
in folds of their upper garments, and went their
way. The Brahman followed close behind them.
Now a second pack of five hundred thieves captured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the first pack of thieves. “For what purpose did you
capture us?” inquired the first. “For ransom-money,”
replied the second. “If you want money,
capture this Brahman. It was he who, by looking
up at the sky, caused a Rain of Riches; he is the man
who gave us this wealth.”</p>

<p>The second pack released the first, captured the
Brahman, and said to him: “Give us wealth too.”
Said the Brahman: “I would gladly give you
wealth. But the conjunction of the moon which
causes the Rain of Riches will not occur for a year
yet. If you want money, have patience, and I will
cause the Rain of Riches then.” At this the thieves
became enraged and said: “Oh, you rascally Brahman!
You caused a Rain of Riches for others but
a moment ago, but you tell us to hold our patience
for another year!” So saying, they cleft the Brahman
in twain with a sharp sword and left him lying
on the road.</p>

<p>Then the second pack pursued the first pack
hotly, fought with; them, killed every man of them,
and took the spoils. Again dividing into two packs,
they fought with each other until one pack of two
hundred and fifty had killed the other. Continuing
in this wise, they killed each other off until there
were only two men left. Thus those thousand men
came to ruin. Now those two men, having gotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
away with the spoils by a ruse, hid the spoils in a
thicket near a certain village. One sat guarding the
spoils with sword in hand; the other, having procured
rice, entered the village to have some porridge
cooked.</p>

<p>“Cupidity is the root of ruin!”</p>

<p>The man sitting by the spoils reflected: “When
this fellow returns, this wealth will have to be
divided into two portions. Suppose I were to strike
him with the sword and kill him the very moment
he returns!” So girding on his sword, he sat watching
for his companion to return.</p>

<p>His companion reflected: “That wealth will have
to be divided into two portions. Suppose I were to
put poison in the porridge, let that fellow eat it,
cause his death, and get the spoils for myself alone!”
So when the porridge was done, he ate some himself,
put poison in the rest, and then took it and went to
the thicket.</p>

<p>The moment the second thief took that porridge
out and set it down, the first thief cleft him in twain
with his sword and flung his remains away in a
secluded spot. Then he ate that porridge and himself
died on the spot. Thus, by reason of that wealth,
every one of those men came to ruin.</p>

<p>As for the Future Buddha, he returned in the
course of a day or two with the ransom-money. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
seeing his teacher where he had left him, but seeing
the spoils scattered all about, he reflected: “It must
be that my teacher disregarded my words and
caused the Rain of Riches; it must be that all of
those men have come to ruin.” And he continued his
walk along the highway.</p>

<p>As he proceeded, he saw his teacher lying on the
highway, cleft in twain. Thought he: “My teacher
disregarded my words and is dead.” Then he
gathered firewood, built a pyre, cremated his
teacher, and honored him with forest-flowers.</p>

<p>As he proceeded, he saw farther on five hundred
thieves who had met destruction; farther on yet,
two hundred and fifty; and so on until finally he
came upon two. Thought he: “These thousand
thieves have come to ruin save only two. There must
be two thieves besides. They also could never have
restrained themselves. Where can they be?”</p>

<p>As he proceeded, he saw the footprints of the two
thieves who had entered the thicket with the spoils.
Proceeding farther, he saw first a heap of riches
wrapped up in a bundle, and then one of the two
thieves dead with a porridge-bowl overturned beside
him. Then he knew all. “Such-and-such they must
have done,” thought he. Then he reflected: “Where
can that fellow be?” Making a search, he found his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
body also flung away in a secluded spot. Then he
reflected:</p>

<p>“Our teacher, because he disregarded my words,
through his own habit of disobedience, through his
own fault, has come to ruin. Moreover through him
a thousand men besides have perished. Alas! By
employing wrong means, for no reason at all, seeking
gain for themselves, these thieves, like our
teacher, must all have come to a fearful end indeed!”
And he recited the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Whoever seeks advantage by wrong means, comes to grief.</div>
<div class="verse">Thieves slew Vedabbha, and all met destruction.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, by the recitation of this stanza, did the
Future Buddha preach the Doctrine. And the
spirits of the forest made the forest ring with their
applause. Then said the Future Buddha: “Just as
our teacher, putting forth effort by wrong means,
at the wrong time, caused the Rain of Riches, and
thus himself met destruction and became the cause
of others’ ruin, precisely so whoever else besides
shall exert himself, seeking advantage for himself
by wrong means, shall himself come to ruin and shall
become the cause of others’ ruin.”</p>

<p>Employing right means, the Future Buddha removed
that wealth to his own home, and during the
remainder of the term of life allotted to him gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
alms and performed the other works of merit. And
when his life came to an end, he passed away, fulfilling
the Path to Heaven.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Said the Teacher: “Monk, not only in your present state of
existence are you disobedient, but in a previous state of existence
also you were disobedient. And because of your habit of
disobedience you came to a fearful end.” And having completed
this parable, he identified the personages in the Birth-story
as follows: “At that time the Brahman Vedabbha was the disobedient
monk, but the pupil was I myself.”</p>

<p>Thus have I heard: Once upon a time the Exalted One was in

<p>The more, monks, the gods of the Thirty-three

<p>Thereupon, monks, Sakka king of gods approached
that anger-eating ogre. And having approached,
he adjusted his upper robe so as to cover

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times, in this very city of Sāvatthi, lived a
house-mistress named Vedehikā. Of Mistress Vedehikā
prevailed the following excellent reputation:
“Gentle is Mistress Vedehikā, meek is Mistress
Vedehikā, tranquil is Mistress Vedehikā.” And
Mistress Vedehikā had a servant named Blackie
who was capable and industrious and performed her
duties well.</p>

<p>Now to Servant Blackie occurred the following
thought: “Of my lady mistress prevails the following
excellent reputation: ‘Gentle is Mistress Vedehikā,
meek is Mistress Vedehikā, tranquil is Mistress
Vedehikā.’ But has her ladyship, in point of
fact, an inward temper which she does not reveal,
or has she not? Or is it solely because I have performed
these duties well that her ladyship does not
reveal an inward temper which, in point of fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
she does possess;—not because she does not possess
it? Suppose I were to test her ladyship!”</p>

<p>Accordingly Servant Blackie got up late in the
day. And Mistress Vedehikā said this to Servant
Blackie: “See here, Blackie!” “What is it, my
lady?” “Why did you get up so late?” “For no
reason at all, my lady.” “For no reason at all, worthless
servant, you got up so late!” And Mistress
Vedehikā frowned in anger and displeasure.</p>

<p>Then to Servant Blackie occurred the following
thought: “Her ladyship does, in point of fact,
possess an inward temper which she does not reveal;—it
is not because she does not possess it. It is
solely because I have performed these duties well
that her ladyship does not reveal an inward temper
which, in point of fact, she does possess;—it is not

<p>Accordingly Servant Blackie got up later in the
day. And Mistress Vedehikā said this to Servant
Blackie: “See here, Blackie!” “What is it, my
lady?” “Why did you get up so late?” “For no
reason at all, my lady.” “For no reason at all,
worthless servant, you got up so late!” And in
anger and displeasure Mistress Vedehikā gave vent
to her displeasure in words.</p>

<p>Then to Servant Blackie occurred the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
thought: “Her ladyship does, in point of fact, possess
an inward temper which she does not reveal;—it
is not because she does not possess it. It is solely
because I have performed these duties well that her
ladyship does not reveal an inward temper which,
in point of fact, she does possess;—it is not because

<p>Accordingly Servant Blackie got up even later
in the day. And Mistress Vedehikā said this to Servant
Blackie: “See here, Blackie!” “What is it, my
lady?” “Why did you get up so late?” “For no
reason at all, my lady.” “For no reason at all,
worthless servant, you got up so late!” And in
anger and displeasure Mistress Vedehikā seized the
pin of the door-bolt and gave her a blow on the head,
breaking her head.</p>

<p>Thereupon Servant Blackie, with broken head
streaming with blood, complained to the neighbors:
“See, my lady, the work of the gentle woman! See,
my lady, the work of the meek woman! See, my
lady, the work of the tranquil woman! For this is
the way a lady acts who keeps but a single servant:
‘You got up too late!’ says she. So what must she
do but seize the pin of the door-bolt and give you a
blow on the head and break your head!”</p>

<p>The result was that after a time Mistress Vedehikā<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
acquired the following evil reputation: “Cruel

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus have I heard: Once upon a time the Exalted One was in
residence at Jetavana, near Sāvatthi. Now at that time there
entered Sāvatthi for alms a company of heretics, both monks
and Brahmans, wandering ascetics, holding heretical views,
patient of heresy, delighting in heresy, relying upon the reliance
of heretical views. There were some monks and Brahmans who
held this doctrine, who held this view: “The world is eternal.
This view alone is truth; any other is folly.” But there were
other monks and Brahmans who held this view: “The world is
not eternal. This view alone is truth; any other is folly.” Some
held that the world is finite, others that the world is infinite.
Some held that the soul and the body are identical, others that
the soul and the body are distinct.</p>

<p>They quarreled and brawled and wrangled and struck one
another with the daggers of their tongues, saying: “This is
right, that is not right;” “This is not right, that is right.”</p>

<p>Now in the morning a company of monks put on their under-garments,
took bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthi for alms.
And when they had made their alms-pilgrimage in Sāvatthi,
they returned from their pilgrimage. And when they had eaten
their breakfast, they approached the Exalted One. And having
approached, they saluted the Exalted One and sat down on
one side. And sitting on one side, those monks reported the
matter to the Exalted One.</p>

<p>“The heretics, O monks, the wandering ascetics, are blind,
without eyes; know not good, know not evil; know not right,
know not wrong. Knowing not good, knowing not evil, knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
not right, knowing not wrong, they quarrel and brawl and
wrangle and strike one another with the daggers of their
tongues, saying: ‘This is right, that is not right;’ ‘This is not
right, that is right.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times, in this very city of Sāvatthi, there
was a certain king. And that king ordered a certain
man: “Come, my man, assemble in one place all the
men in Sāvatthi who are blind from birth.” “Yes,
your majesty,” said that man to that king. And
when, in obedience to the king’s command, he had
laid hands on all the men in Sāvatthi who were blind
from birth, he approached that king. And having
approached, he said this to that king: “Your
majesty, the blind from birth in Sāvatthi are assembled
for you.” “Very well! Now let the blind
men feel of the elephant.” “Yes, your majesty,”
said that man to that king. And in obedience to the
king’s command he let the blind men feel of the
elephant, saying: “This, O blind men, is what an
elephant is like.”</p>

<p>Some of the blind men he let feel of the elephant’s
head, saying: “This, O blind men, is what an elephant
is like.” Some of the blind men he let feel of
the elephant’s ears, saying: “This, O blind men,
is what an elephant is like.” Some of the blind men
he let feel of the elephant’s tusks, saying: “This, O
blind men, is what an elephant is like.” Others he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
let feel of the trunk, saying the same. Others he let
feel of the belly, others of the legs, others of the
back, others of the tail, saying to each and to all:
“This, O blind men, is what an elephant is like.”</p>

<p>Now when that man had let the blind men feel
of the elephant, he approached that king. And
having approached, he said this to that king: “Your
majesty, those blind men have felt of the elephant;
do as you think fit.”</p>

<p>Then that king approached those blind men. And
having approached, he said this to those blind men:
“Blind men, have you felt of the elephant?” “Yes,
your majesty, we have felt of the elephant.” “Tell
me, blind men, what is an elephant like?”</p>

<p>The blind men who had felt of the elephant’s
head, said: “Your majesty, an elephant is like a
water-pot.” The blind men who had felt of the elephant’s
ears, said: “Your majesty, an elephant is
like a winnowing-basket.” The blind men who had
felt of the elephant’s tusks, said: “Your majesty,
an elephant is like a plow-share.” Those who had
felt of the trunk, said: “An elephant is like a plow-pole.”
Those who had felt of the belly, said: “An
elephant is like a granary.” Those who had felt of
the legs, said: “An elephant is like pillars.” Those
who had felt of the back, said: “An elephant is like
a mortar.” The blind men who had felt of the elephant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
tail, said: “Your majesty, an elephant is
like a fan.”</p>

<p>And they fought among themselves with their
fists, saying: “This is what an elephant is like, that
is not what an elephant is like;” “This is not what
an elephant is like, that is what an elephant is like.”
And thereat that king was delighted.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the Teacher addressed the monks as
follows: “Monks, contact with the corrupt is a bad thing, an
injurious thing. Indeed, why should it be necessary to discuss
the injurious effect on human beings of contact with the corrupt,
when in times past even a senseless mango tree, with
flavor as sweet as the flavor of celestial fruit, through contact
with sour, unpalatable nimbs, turned sour and bitter?”</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Part. 1. Gem, hatchet, drum, and bowl.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
four Brahman brothers in the kingdom of Kāsi
adopted the life of ascetics, and building a row of
leaf-huts in the Himālaya region, took up their
abode there. The eldest of the four brothers died
and was reborn as Sakka, king of gods. Knowing
who he had been, he went from time to time, every
seven or eight days, and ministered to his former
brothers.</p>

<p>One day he saluted the eldest ascetic, sat down on
one side, and asked: “Reverend Sir, is there anything
you need?” The ascetic, who was suffering
from jaundice, said: “I need fire.” Sakka gave him
a little hatchet. Said the ascetic: “Who will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
this and fetch me wood?” Then Sakka said to him:
“When, Reverend Sir, you need wood, just rub
this hatchet with your hand and say: ‘Please fetch
me wood and make me a fire.’ And the hatchet will
fetch wood, make a fire, and turn it over to you.”</p>

<p>Having given him the little hatchet, Sakka went
to the second ascetic and asked: “Reverend Sir,
what do you need?” Past his leaf-hut ran an elephant-track.
Since the elephants bothered him, he
said: “The elephants annoy me; drive them away.”
Sakka presented a drum to him, saying, “Reverend
Sir, if you beat this side, your enemies will flee; if
you beat that, they will become kindly disposed and
will surround you with a fourfold army.”</p>

<p>Having given him the drum, Sakka went to the
youngest ascetic and asked: “Reverend Sir, what do
you want?” He also was afflicted with jaundice;
therefore he said: “I want curds.” Sakka gave him
a bowl of curds, saying: “If you invert this and
make a wish, the curds will turn into a mighty river,
will set flowing a mighty flood, and will even be able
to get and give you a kingdom.” So saying, he went
his way.</p>

<p>From that time on the little hatchet made fire
for the eldest brother; when the second brother beat
the drum, the elephants fled; the youngest brother
enjoyed his curds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>At that time a boar, rooting among the ruins of
a village, caught sight of a gem endowed with magical
power. He bit the gem, and by its magical power
rose into the air. Seeing a little island in mid-ocean,
he thought: “There now is the place for me to live.”
So he descended and made his home in a pleasant
place under a fig tree.</p>

<p>One day the boar lay down at the foot of that
tree, placed the gem in front of him, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Now a certain man who lived in the kingdom of
Kāsi, driven from home by his mother and father
with the remark, “He’s no good to us,” went to a
certain seaport, hired himself out to mariners, and
embarked on a ship. In mid-ocean the ship sprang
a leak, and he floated to that island on a plank.
While seeking wild fruits he saw that boar. Creeping
up, he seized the gem. By its magical power he
rose into the air. Seating himself on the fig tree, he
thought: “This boar, become an air-voyager by the
magical power of this gem, lives here, I suppose.
But I must not go back without first of all killing
him and eating his flesh.” He broke off a twig and
let it fall on the boar’s head. The boar woke up, but
not seeing the gem, ran this way and that, all of a
tremble. The man sitting in the tree laughed. The
boar looked, and seeing him, ran his head against the
tree, and died then and there. The man came down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
made a fire, and cooked the boar’s flesh and ate it.
Then he rose into the air and passed over the tops of
the Himālayas.</p>

<p>Seeing a region of hermitages, he descended at
the hermitage of the eldest ascetic. He lived there
for two or three days, performed the major and
minor duties for the ascetic, and saw the magical
power of the little hatchet. “This I must get,”
thought he. Accordingly, after demonstrating to the
ascetic the magical power of the gem, he said:
“Reverend Sir, take this gem and give me the little
hatchet.” The ascetic, having a desire to travel
through the air, took the gem and gave him the little
hatchet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_086a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_086a.jpg" alt="He bit the gem, and by its magical power rose into the air.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>He bit the gem, and by its magical power rose into the air.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The man took the little hatchet and went a short
distance. Then he rubbed the little hatchet and said:
“Little hatchet, chop off the ascetic’s head and bring
me the gem.” The little hatchet went and chopped
off the ascetic’s head and brought him the gem. The
man put the little hatchet in a secret place, and then
went to the second ascetic and lived with him for a
few days. Seeing the magical power of the drum, he
gave the second ascetic the gem, took the drum, and
in the same way as before caused his head also to
be cut off. Then he approached the youngest ascetic.
Seeing the magical power of the bowl of curds, he
gave the youngest ascetic the gem, took the bowl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>of curds, and in the same way as before caused his
head to be cut off.</p>

<p>Then he took the gem and the little hatchet and
the drum and the bowl of curds, and rose into the
air. Halting not far from Benāres, he sent, by the
hand of a certain man, the following message to the
king of Benāres: “Give me battle or the kingdom!”
As soon as the king heard the message, he said:
“Let’s catch the bandit;” and sallied forth. The man
beat the proper side of the drum, and a fourfold
army surrounded him. Perceiving that the king had
deployed his forces, he turned the bowl of curds
loose. A mighty river began to flow, and the multitude
sank down in the curds and were unable to
extricate themselves. Then he rubbed the little
hatchet and said: “Bring me the king’s head.” The
little hatchet went and brought the king’s head and
laid it at his feet. Not a single soldier had the power
to lift a weapon. Accompanied by a mighty force,
the man entered the city and caused himself to be
sprinkled king. Having become king under the
name King of the Curds, he ruled with righteousness.</p>

<h3><i>Part 2. Corrupt fruit from a good tree.</i></h3>

<p>One day, while he was amusing himself in the
mighty river, in an enclosure formed by a net, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
floated up and lodged in the net a single mango
fruit fit for the gods. When they lifted the net they
saw it and gave it to the king. It was of large size,
as big as a water-pot, perfectly round, and of a
golden color. The king asked his foresters: “What
is that the fruit of?” “The fruit of a mango tree.”
Having eaten it, he caused the stone to be planted
in his own garden, and to be sprinkled with milk and
water. The tree sprouted, and in the third year bore
fruit.</p>

<p>Great was the honor rendered to the mango. They
sprinkled it with milk and water, they made marks
of the spread hand with scented ointment on it, they
festooned it with wreaths and ropes of flowers, they
burned lamps with perfumed oil before it, and round
about it they hung a curtain of fine cloth.</p>

<p>The fruit was sweet and of a golden color. When
the king sent the fruit of the mango to other kings,
he pierced with a thorn the spot where the sprout
starts, for fear a tree might sprout from the stone.
When, after eating the mango fruit, they planted
the stone, nothing happened. “What, pray, can be
the cause of this?” they inquired, and discovered
the cause.</p>

<p>Now a certain other king summoned his gardener
and asked: “Can you spoil the flavor of my rival’s
mango fruit and make it bitter?” “Yes, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
majesty.” “Very well, go.” So saying, he gave him
a thousand pieces of money and sent him off. The
gardener went to Benāres, caused the king to be
informed that a gardener had arrived, managed to
have himself summoned by the king, and entering
the palace, made obeisance to the king. “Are you
the gardener?” asked the king. “Yes, your majesty,”
said the gardener, and described his own
marvelous powers. Said the king: “Go, assist our
gardener.”</p>

<p>From that time on the two men cared for the
garden. The newly arrived gardener caused flowers
to blossom out of season and fruits to grow out of
season, and made the garden a charming place. The
king, pleased with the new gardener, dismissed the
old gardener, and gave the new gardener exclusive
charge of the garden. The new gardener, realizing
that the garden was in his own hands, planted nimbs
and pot-herbs and creepers all around the mango
tree.</p>

<p>In the course of time the nimbs grew up. Roots
with roots, branches with branches, were in contact,
entangled, intertwined. Merely through this contact
with the sour, unpalatable nimbs, the sweet
fruit of the mango turned bitter, and its flavor became
like the flavor of the leaves of the nimbs. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
gardener, knowing that the fruit of the mango had
turned bitter, fled.</p>

<p>The king went to the garden and ate a mango
fruit. As soon as he put the mango into his mouth,
perceiving that the juice tasted like the vile juice
of the nimb, he was unable to swallow it, and coughing
it up, spat it out. Now at that time the Future
Buddha was his counsellor in temporal and spiritual
matters. The king addressed the Future Buddha:
“Wise man, this tree is just as well cared for now
as it was of old. But in spite of this, its fruit has
turned bitter. What, pray, is the reason?” And by
way of inquiry he uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Color, fragrance, flavor, had this mango before.</div>
<div class="verse">Receiving the same honor, why has the mango bitter fruit?</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the Future Buddha told him the reason by
uttering the second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Your mango, O king, is surrounded with nimbs,</div>
<div class="verse">Root touches root, branches entwine about branches.</div>
<div class="verse">Through contact with the bad, therefore your mango has bitter fruit.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The king, hearing his words, had every one of the
nimbs and pot-herbs chopped down, the roots pulled
up, the sour earth round about removed, sweet earth
put in its place, and the mango fed with milk and
water, sweetened water, and perfumed water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Through contact with sweet juices the mango became
perfectly sweet again. The king gave the regular
gardener sole charge of the garden, and after
living out his allotted term of life, passed away
according to his deeds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion the Teacher, referring to the self-mortification
of the Hindu ascetics, said to the monks: “Monks,
there is no value, no merit, in their self-mortification. It is like
the ‘rat-a-tat’ the little hare heard.” Said the monks: “We do
not understand what you mean by saying that it is like the
‘rat-a-tat’ the little hare heard. Tell us about it, Reverend Sir.”
So in response to their request the Teacher related the following
Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was reborn as a lion, and when
he grew up, lived in a forest. At that time, near the
Western Ocean, grew a grove of cocoanut trees
intermingled with Vilva trees. There, at the foot of
a Vilva tree, under a cocoanut sapling, lived a little
hare. One day, returning with food, he lay down
under a cocoanut leaf and thought: “If this earth
should collapse, what would ever become of me?”</p>

<p>At that very instant a Vilva fruit fell on top of
the cocoanut leaf. At the sound of it the little hare
thought: “This earth is certainly collapsing!” And
springing to his feet, back he ran, without so much
as taking a look. As he was running away as fast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
he could in fear of death, another little hare saw him
and asked: “Why, pray, are you running away in
such a fright?” “Oh, don’t ask me!” And he kept
right on running, in spite of the fact that the other
little hare kept asking: “Oh! what is it? Oh! what is
it?” The other little hare turned around, and without
so much as taking a look, said: “The earth is
collapsing here!” He also ran away, following the
first.</p>

<p>In the same way a third little hare saw the second,
and a fourth the third, until finally there were a
hundred thousand little hares running away together.
A deer saw them,—also a boar, an elk, a
buffalo, an ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion, and an
elephant. Seeing, each asked: “What’s this?” “The
earth is collapsing here!” Each ran away. Thus, in
the course of time, there was an army of animals a
league in size.</p>

<p>At that time the Future Buddha, seeing that
army running away, asked: “What’s this?” “The
earth is collapsing here!” When the Future Buddha
heard this, he thought: “No such thing! The earth
is collapsing nowhere! It must certainly be that they
failed to understand something they heard. But if
I do not put forth effort, they will all perish. I will
grant them their lives.”</p>

<p>With the speed of a lion he preceded them to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
foot of a mountain and thrice roared the roar of a
lion. Terrified with fear of the lion, they turned
around and stood all huddled together. The lion
made his way in among them and asked: “Why are
you running away?” “The earth is collapsing!”
“Who saw it collapsing?” “The elephants know.”
He asked the elephants. Said the elephants: “We
don’t know; the lions know.” Said the lions: “We
don’t know; the tigers know.” The tigers: “The
rhinoceroses know.” The rhinoceroses: “The oxen
know.” The oxen: “The buffaloes.” The buffaloes:
“The elks.” The elks: “The boars.” The boars:
“The deer.” The deer: “We don’t know; the little
hares know.”</p>

<p>When the little hares were asked, they pointed
out that little hare and said: “He’s the one that told
us.” So the lion asked the little hare: “Friend, is it
true, as you say, that the earth is collapsing?” “Yes,
master, I saw it.” “Where were you living when you
saw it?” asked the lion. “Near the Western Ocean,
in a grove of cocoanut trees mingled with Vilva
trees. For there, at the foot of a Vilva tree, under a
cocoanut sapling, beneath a cocoanut leaf, I lay and
thought: ‘If the earth collapses, where shall I go?’
That very instant I heard the sound of the earth
collapsing. So I ran away.”</p>

<p>The lion thought: “Evidently a Vilva fruit fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
on top of that cocoanut leaf and made a ‘rat-a-tat,’
and this hare here, hearing that sound, came to the
conclusion: ‘The earth is collapsing!’ I will find out
for a fact.” So the lion, taking the little hare with
him, reassured the throng, saying: “I am going to
find out for a fact whether or not the earth collapsed
at the spot where the little hare saw what he saw;
having so done, I will return. Until I return, all of
you remain right here.”</p>

<p>So taking the little hare on his back, he sprang
forward with the speed of a lion. And setting the
little hare down in the cocoanut grove, he said:
“Come, show me the spot where you saw what you
saw.” “I don’t dare, master.” “Come, don’t be
afraid.” The little hare, not daring to approach the
Vilva tree, stood no great distance off and said:
“That, master, is the spot where it went ‘rat-a-tat.’”
So saying, he uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rat-a-tat” it went,—I wish you luck,—</div>
<div class="verse">In the region where I dwell.</div>
<div class="verse">But as for me, I do not know</div>
<div class="verse">What made that “rat-a-tat.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the little hare said this, the lion went to the
foot of the Vilva tree, looked at the spot beneath the
cocoanut leaf where the little hare had lain, and observed
that a Vilva fruit had fallen on top of the
cocoanut leaf. And knowing for a fact that the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
had not collapsed, he took the little hare on his back,
went quickly, with the speed of a lion, to the assemblage
of animals, informed them of all the facts,
reassured the throng of animals by saying, “Fear
not,” and released the little hare.</p>

<p>For if, at that time, the Future Buddha had not
come to the rescue, they would all have run down
into the sea and perished. It was through the Future
Buddha that they obtained their lives.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the Exalted One reproved the monks for
begging. Said he:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times a certain monk dwelt on a slope of
Himavat in a certain forest-grove. Not far from
that forest-grove was a great marsh, a swamp. Now
a large flock of birds sought food in that swamp in
the daytime, returning to that forest-grove at eventide
to roost. Now that monk, driven away by the
noise of that flock of birds, approached me, and
having approached, saluted me and sat down on one
side. And as he sat on one side, I said this to that
monk:</p>

<p>“I trust, monk, that you have suffered no discomfort.
I trust that you have received sufficient
sustenance. I trust that you have made your journey
without fatigue. And, monk, whence have you
come?”</p>

<p>“I have suffered no discomfort, Exalted One. I
have received sufficient sustenance. I have made my
journey without fatigue. Reverend Sir, on a slope
of Himavat is a large forest-grove. And not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
from that forest-grove is a great marsh, a swamp.
Now a large flock of birds seek food in that swamp
in the daytime, returning to that forest-grove at
eventide to roost. Thence, Reverend Sir, do I come,
driven away by the noise of that flock of birds.”</p>

<p>“But, monk, do you wish that flock of birds never
to come back again?” “I wish that flock of birds
never to come back again.”</p>

<p>“Well then, monk, go there, plunge into that
forest-grove, and throughout the watches of the
night cry out: ‘Let the pretty birds hear me, as
many as roost in this forest-grove! I want feathers!
Let the pretty birds each give me a feather!’”</p>

<p>So that monk went there, plunged into that
forest-grove, and throughout the watches of the
night cried out: “Let the pretty birds hear me, as
many as roost in this forest-grove! I want feathers!
Let the pretty birds each give me a feather!”</p>

<p>Thereupon that flock of birds, reflecting, “The
monk begs feathers, the monk wants feathers,” departed
from that forest-grove. When they departed,
they departed indeed, and never came back again.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the Exalted One reproved the monks for
begging. Said he:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times two ascetics, brothers, lived by the
Ganges river. Now Jewel-neck, a dragon-king,
came out of the Ganges, approached the younger
ascetic, and having approached, encircled the
younger ascetic seven times with his coils and rose
and spread his huge hood over his head. And the
younger ascetic, for fear of that dragon, became
lean, dried-up, pale, yellow as ever was yellow, his
body strewn with veins.</p>

<p>The older ascetic saw the younger ascetic lean,
dried-up, pale, yellow as ever was yellow, his body
strewn with veins. Seeing, he said this to the
younger ascetic: “Why are you lean, dried-up, pale,
yellow as ever was yellow, your body strewn with
veins?” “While I was here, Jewel-neck, a dragon-king,
came out of the Ganges river, approached me,
and having approached, encircled me seven times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
with his coils and rose and spread his huge hood over
my head. For fear of him I am lean, dried-up, pale,
yellow as ever was yellow, my body strewn with
veins.”</p>

<p>“But do you wish that dragon never to come back
again?” “I wish that dragon never to come back
again.” “Well, but do you see anything on that
dragon?” “I see he wears a jewel on his neck.”
“Well then, ask that dragon for the jewel, saying:
‘Give me the jewel! I want the jewel!’”</p>

<p>Now Jewel-neck the dragon-king came out of the
Ganges river, approached the younger ascetic, and
having approached, stood aside. As he stood aside,
the younger ascetic said this to Jewel-neck the
dragon-king: “Give me the jewel! I want the
jewel!” Thereupon Jewel-neck the dragon-king, reflecting,
“The monk begs the jewel, the monk wants
the jewel,” quickly enough departed.</p>

<p>Three times did the younger ascetic beg the jewel
of Jewel-neck the dragon-king, and three times did
Jewel-neck the dragon-king depart. The third time,
Jewel-neck the dragon-king addressed the younger
ascetic with stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">My food and drink, abundant, choice,</div>
<div class="verse">I get by the power of this jewel.</div>

<div class="verse">Nor will I even come back again to your hermitage.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
<div class="verse">Like a lad with sand-washed sword in hand,</div>
<div class="verse">You frighten me, asking for the stone.</div>
<div class="verse">This I will not give you,—you ask too much;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor will I even come back again to your hermitage.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thereupon Jewel-neck the dragon-king, reflecting,
“The monk begs the jewel, the monk wants the
jewel,” departed. When he departed, he departed
indeed, and never came back again. And the younger
ascetic, because he saw no more that dragon so fair
to see, became more than ever lean, dried-up, pale,
yellow as ever was yellow, his body strewn with
veins.</p>

<p>When the older ascetic saw the younger ascetic
altered in appearance, he inquired the reason. The
younger ascetic told him. Then the older ascetic addressed
the younger ascetic with a stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="center">Jātaka 258: ii. 283-286.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion the Exalted One reproved the monks
for begging. Said he: “Monks, begging is offensive even to
dragons, though the World of Dragons wherein they dwell is
filled to overflowing with the Seven Jewels. How much more so
must it be to human beings, from whom it is as difficult to
wring a penny as it is to skin a flint!” So saying, he related the
following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at
Benāres, the Future Buddha was reborn in a Brahman
household of great wealth. When he was old
enough to walk and could run hither and thither,
another being of merit also received a new existence
as his brother. When both brothers reached manhood,
their mother and father died. In agitation of
heart over their death, both brothers adopted the life
of ascetics, and building leaf-huts on the bank of
the Ganges, took up their residence there. The older
brother’s hut was up the Ganges; the younger
brother’s hut was down the Ganges.</p>

<p>Now one day a dragon-king named Jewel-neck
came forth from the World of Dragons, walked
along the bank of the Ganges disguised as a Brahman
youth, came to the hermitage of the younger
ascetic, bowed, and sat down on one side. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
dragon-king and the younger ascetic greeted each
other in a cordial manner, and became fast friends
and inseparable companions.</p>

<p>Every day Jewel-neck would come to the hermitage
of the younger ascetic and sit down and talk
and converse with him. When it was time for him
to go, out of affection for the ascetic he would lay
aside his human form, encircle the ascetic with his
coils, and embrace him, holding his huge hood over
his head. Having remained in this position for a
time, and having dispelled his affection, he would
unwind his body, bow to the ascetic, and go back
again to his own abode.</p>

<p>The ascetic, for fear of him, became lean, dried-up,
pale, yellow as ever was yellow, his body strewn
with veins. One day he went to visit his brother. The
latter asked him: “Why are you lean, dried-up,
pale, yellow as ever was yellow, your body strewn
with veins?” He told him the facts. The older ascetic
asked: “But do you or do you not wish that dragon
never to come back again?” The younger ascetic
said: “I do not.” “But when that dragon-king
comes to your hermitage, what ornament does he
wear?” “A jewel.”</p>

<p>“Well then, when that dragon-king comes to your
hermitage, before he has a chance to sit down, ask,
saying: ‘Give me the jewel.’ If you do so, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
dragon-king will depart without so much as encircling
you with his coils. On the next day you must
stand at the door of your hermitage and ask him
just as he approaches. On the third day you must
stand on the bank of the Ganges and ask him just
as he comes out of the water. If you do so, he will
not come back to your hermitage.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_104a">

him with his coils.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>Every day Jewel-neck the dragon-king would encircle
him with his coils.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Very well,” assented the ascetic, and went to
his own leaf-hut. On the next day the dragon-king
came and stopped at the hermitage. The moment he
stopped, the ascetic asked: “Give me this jewel you
wear.” Without so much as sitting down, the dragon-king
fled. On the second day the ascetic, standing at
the door of the hermitage, said to the dragon-king
just as he approached: “Yesterday you would not
give me the jewel; to-day I must have it.” Without
so much as entering the hermitage, the dragon-king
fled. On the third day the ascetic said to the dragon-king
just as he came out of the water: “This is the
third day I have asked; give me this jewel now.”
The dragon-king, still remaining in the water, refused
the ascetic, reciting these two stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">My food and drink, abundant, choice,</div>
<div class="verse">I get by the power of this jewel.</div>
<div class="verse">This I will not give you,—you ask too much;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor will I even come back again to your hermitage.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
<div class="verse">Like a lad with sand-washed sword in hand,</div>
<div class="verse">You frighten me, asking for the stone.</div>
<div class="verse">This I will not give you,—you ask too much;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor will I even come back again to your hermitage.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So saying, that dragon-king plunged into the
water, went back to his own World of Dragons, and
never came back again. And that ascetic, because he
saw no more that dragon-king so fair to see, became
more than ever lean, dried-up, pale, yellow as ever
was yellow, his body strewn with veins.</p>

<p>Now the older ascetic, thinking, “I will find out
how my younger brother is getting on,” went to visit
him. Seeing that he was suffering more than ever
from jaundice, he said: “How comes it that you are
suffering more than ever from jaundice?” “Because
I see no more that dragon so fair to see.” “This
ascetic cannot get along without the dragon-king,”
concluded the older ascetic, and recited the third
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">One should not beg or seek to get what is dear to another.</div>
<div class="verse">Odious does one become by asking overmuch.</div>
<div class="verse">When the Brahman asked the dragon for the jewel,</div>
<div class="verse">Never again did the dragon let himself be seen.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Having thus addressed him, the older ascetic
comforted him, saying: “Henceforth grieve not;”
and went back again to his own hermitage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Said the Teacher: “Thus, monks, even to dragons, though
the World of Dragons wherein they dwell is filled to overflowing
with the Seven Jewels, begging is offensive. How much
more so must it be to human beings!” And having completed
this parable, he identified the personages in the Birth-story as
follows: “At that time the younger brother was my favorite
disciple, but the older brother was I myself.”</p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 203: ii. 144-148.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>There is friendship ’twixt me and Virūpakkha snakes.</i> This
parable was related by the Teacher while he was in residence
at Jetavana with reference to a certain monk.</p>

<p>The story goes that while he was splitting wood at the door
of the room where the monks took hot baths, a snake came out
of a hole in a rotten log and bit him on the big toe. He died on
the spot. The news of his death and of how he came to die
spread throughout the monastery. In the Hall of Truth the
monks began to discuss the incident: “Brethren, such-and-such
a monk, they say, while splitting wood at the door of the room
where the monks take hot baths, was bitten by a snake and died
on the spot.”</p>

<p>The Teacher drew near and inquired: “Monks, what is the
subject that engages your attention as you sit here all gathered
together?” “Such-and-such,” said they. “Monks,” said the
Teacher, “if that monk had cultivated friendship for the four
royal families of snakes, the snake would not have bitten him.
For even ascetics of old, before a Buddha had arisen, cultivated
friendship for the four royal families of snakes, and thus obtained
deliverance from the perils that arose through those
royal families of snakes.” So saying, he related the following
Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>In times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at
Benāres, the Future Buddha was reborn in the kingdom
of Kāsi in the household of a Brahman. When
he reached manhood, he renounced the pleasures of
sense, retired from the world and adopted the life
of an ascetic, and developed the Supernatural
Powers and the Attainments. By supernatural
power, in the region of Himavat, at a bend in the
Ganges, he created a hermitage, and there he resided,
surrounded by a company of ascetics, diverting
himself with the diversions of the Trances.</p>

<p>At that time, on the bank of the Ganges, reptiles
of various kinds wrought such havoc among the
ascetics that many of them lost their lives. Ascetics
reported that fact to the Future Buddha. The
Future Buddha caused all of the ascetics to be assembled,
and said to them: “If you would cultivate
friendship for the four royal families of snakes, the
snakes would not bite you. Therefore from this time
forth, cultivate friendship for the four royal families
of snakes in the following way.” So saying, he recited
this stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and Virūpakkha snakes,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and Erāpatha snakes,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and Chabyāputta snakes,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and Black Gotamaka snakes.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Having thus pointed out to them the four royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
families of serpents, he said: “In case you are successful
in cultivating friendship for these, reptiles
will not bite you or annoy you.” So saying, he recited
the second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and living beings without feet,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and living beings with two feet,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and living beings with four feet,</div>
<div class="verse">There is friendship ’twixt me and living beings with many feet.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Having thus set forth Cultivation of Friendship
in the usual form, he next set it forth by way of
prayer, reciting this stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let no living being without feet injure me!</div>
<div class="verse">Let no living being with two feet injure me!</div>
<div class="verse">Let no living being with four feet injure me!</div>
<div class="verse">Let no living being with many feet injure me!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Next, setting forth Cultivation of Friendship
without respect of persons, he recited this stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let all creatures that live,—let all creatures that breathe,—</div>
<div class="verse">Let all creatures that exist,—one and all,—</div>
<div class="indent4">Let all meet with prosperity!</div>
<div class="indent4">Let none come unto any adversity!</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Thus,” said he, “cultivate friendship for all
living beings without respect of persons.” Having
so said, he spoke once more, to bid them meditate on
the virtues of the Three Jewels. Said he: “Infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
is the Buddha! Infinite is the Doctrine! Infinite is
the Order!”</p>

<p>When the Future Buddha had thus pointed out
that the virtues of the Three Jewels are infinite, he
said: “Meditate on the virtues of these Three
Jewels.” Having so said, in order to point out that
living beings are finite, he continued: “Finite are
creeping things,—snakes, scorpions, centipedes,
spiders, lizards, rats and mice!”</p>

<p>Having so said, the Future Buddha declared:
“Since lust, ill-will, and delusion, which exist in
these creatures, are the qualities which make creatures
finite, therefore these creeping things are
finite.” And he said: “By the supernatural power of
the Three Jewels, which are infinite, let those of
us who are finite, obtain protection for ourselves
both by night and by day.” And he said: “Thus
meditate on the virtues of the Three Jewels.”
Having so said, in order to point out what more
must yet be done, he recited this stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I have wrought defense for myself!</div>
<div class="verse">I have wrought protection for myself!</div>
<div class="verse">Begone, living beings!</div>
<div class="verse">I here do homage to the Exalted One</div>
<div class="verse">And to the Seven Supreme Buddhas!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Said the Future Buddha: “In the very act of
rendering homage, meditate on the Seven Buddhas.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Thus the Future Buddha composed this protective
charm for the company of ascetics and gave it to
them.</p>

<p>From that time on the company of ascetics, abiding
steadfast in the admonition of the Future
Buddha, cultivated friendliness, meditated on the
virtues of the Buddhas. Even as they thus meditated
on the virtues of the Buddhas, all of the reptiles disappeared.
As for the Future Buddha, through the
cultivation of the Exalted States, he attained the
goal of the World of Brahmā.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion the Exalted One admonished a company
of monks to show proper respect for their elders. Said he:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> former times, monks, on a slope of Himavat,
grew a huge banyan tree. Near it lived three friends:
a partridge and a monkey and an elephant. They
lived without respect or deference for each other,
having no common life. Now, monks, to these
friends occurred the following thought: “If only we
knew which one of us was the oldest, we would
respect, reverence, venerate, and honor him, and we
would abide steadfast in his admonitions.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, monks, the partridge and the
monkey asked the elephant: “How far back, sir, can
you remember?” “Sirs, when I was a youngster, I
used to walk over this banyan tree, keeping it between
my thighs; the little tips of the shoots would
just touch my belly. As far back as that, sirs, can I
remember.”</p>

<p>Next, monks, the partridge and the elephant
asked the monkey: “How far back, sir, can you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
remember?” “Sirs, when I was a youngster, I used
to sit on the ground and eat the little tips of the
shoots of this banyan tree. As far back as that, sirs,
can I remember.”</p>

<p>Finally, monks, the monkey and the elephant
asked the partridge: “How far back, sir, can you
remember?” “In yonder open space, sirs, grew a
huge banyan tree. I ate one of its fruits and dropped
the seed in this place. From that sprang this banyan
tree. At that time also, sirs, I was the oldest.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, monks, the monkey and the elephant
said this to the partridge: “You, sir, are our
elder. You will we respect, reverence, venerate, and
honor, and in your admonitions will we abide steadfast.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, monks, the partridge prevailed
upon the monkey and the elephant to take upon
themselves the Five Precepts, and himself also took
upon himself the Five Precepts and walked therein.
They lived in respect and deference for each other,
and had a common life. After death, upon dissolution
of the body, they were reborn in a place of bliss,
in a heavenly world. This, monks, was called the
Holy Life of the Partridge.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the Teacher admonished a company
of monks to show proper respect for their elders. Said he: “In
former times, monks, even animals reflected: ‘But it is not
becoming in us that we should live without respect or deference
for each other, having no common life. Let us find out which
one of us is the oldest, and to him let us offer respectful greetings
and the other marks of courtesy.’ And when, after diligent
inquiry, they knew, ‘He is our elder,’ to him did they offer
respectful greetings and the other marks of courtesy. And
having so done, they departed, fulfilling the Path to Heaven.”
So saying, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, on a slope of Himavat, near a certain
huge banyan tree, lived three friends: a partridge,
a monkey, an elephant. They were without
respect or deference for each other, having no
common life. And to them occurred the following
thought: “It is not proper for us to live thus. Suppose
we were to live hereafter offering respectful
greetings and the other marks of courtesy to that
one of us who is the oldest!” “But which one of us is
the oldest?” they considered. “This is the way!” said
the three animals one day as they sat at the foot of
the banyan tree.</p>

<p>So the partridge and the monkey asked the elephant:
“Master elephant, since how long have you
known this banyan tree?” He said: “Friends, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
I was a young elephant, I used to go with this
banyan sapling between my thighs. Moreover, when
I stood with the tree between my thighs, the tips of
its branches used to rub against my belly. Thus I
have known this tree from the time it was a sapling.”</p>

<p>Next the other two animals, in the same way as
before, asked the monkey. He said: “Friends, when
I was a young monkey, I used to sit on the earth,
extend my neck, and eat the tips of the shoots of this
banyan tree. Thus I have known it since it was very
small.”</p>

<p>Finally the other two animals, in the same way as
before, asked the partridge. He said: “Friends, in
former times, in such-and-such a place, grew a huge
banyan tree. I ate its fruits and dropped its seed in
this place. From that sprang this tree. Thus I know
this tree from the time when it had not yet sprouted.
Therefore I am older than you.” Thus spoke the
partridge.</p>

<p>Thereupon the monkey and the elephant said to
the wise partridge: “Master, you are older than we.
Henceforth to you will we offer respect, reverence,
veneration, salutation, and honor; to you will we
offer respectful greeting, rising on meeting, homage
with joined hands, and proper courtesy; in your
admonitions will we abide steadfast. From this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
forth, therefore, be good enough to give us admonition
and needed instruction.”</p>

<p>From that time forth the partridge gave them
admonition, established them in the Precepts, and
himself also took upon himself the Precepts. And
those three animals, established in the Precepts,
showed respect and deference for each other, and
had a common life. When their life was come to an
end, they attained the goal of a heavenly world. The
taking upon themselves by these three animals of
the Precepts was called the Holy Life of the Partridge.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For, monks, those animals lived in respect and deference
for each other. Why is it that you, who have retired from the
world under a Doctrine and Discipline so well taught, do not
live in respect and deference for each other?”</p>

<p>When the Teacher had thus related this parable, he assumed
the prerogative of One Supremely Enlightened and uttered
the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Men versed in the Law who honor the aged</div>
<div class="verse">Have praise even in this life</div>
<div class="verse">And in the next life are in bliss.</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the Teacher had thus extolled the practice of honoring
the oldest, he joined the connection and identified the personages
in the Birth-story as follows: “At that time the elephant
was one of my disciples, the monkey was another, but the
wise partridge was I myself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus have I heard: Once upon a time the Exalted One was in
residence at Jetavana. At that time the Exalted One addressed
the monks: “Monks!” “Reverend Sir!” replied those monks to
the Exalted One. The Exalted One said this:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times, monks, a hawk attacked a quail with
violence and caught it. Now, monks, as the hawk
was carrying off the quail, the quail thus lamented:
“I am indeed unfortunate, I possess little merit,—I
who walked in forbidden ground, in a foreign
region. If to-day I had walked in my own ground,
in the region of my fathers, this hawk would not
have been equal to a combat with me.”</p>

<p>“But, quail, what is your feeding-ground? What
is the region of your fathers?”</p>

<p>“A field of clods, turned up by the plow.”</p>

<p>Then, monks, the hawk, not exerting his strength,
not asserting his strength, released the quail. “Go,
quail! Even there you will not escape from me.”
Then, monks, the quail went to the field of clods,
turned up by the plow, and mounting a big clod,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
stood and called the hawk: “Come now, hawk, I
dare you! Come now, hawk, I dare you!”</p>

<p>Then, monks, the hawk, exerting his strength,
asserting his strength, flapped both his wings
and attacked the quail with violence. When, monks,
the quail knew: “This hawk is coming for me with a
vengeance!” he entered a crack in that very clod.
And, monks, the hawk struck his breast against that
very clod.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For, monks, so it goes with whoever walks in forbidden
ground, in a foreign region. Therefore, monks, walk not in forbidden
ground, in a foreign region. If, monks, you walk in
forbidden ground, in a foreign region, the Evil One will obtain
entrance, the Evil One will obtain lodgment. And what, monks,
is forbidden ground, a foreign region? The Five Pleasures of
Sense. What are the Five? Pleasurable Sights, Sounds, Odors,
Tastes, Contacts. And what, monks, is lawful ground, the
region of the fathers? The Four Earnest Meditations. What are
the Four? Meditation on the Body, on the Sensations, on the
Thoughts, on the Conditions of Existence. Walk, monks, in
lawful ground, in the region of the fathers. If, monks, you walk
in lawful ground, in the region of the fathers, the Evil One
will not obtain entrance, the Evil One will not obtain lodgment.”</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Jātaka 168: ii. 58-60.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A hawk flying strong.</i> This stanza was recited by the
Teacher while in residence at Jetavana to explain his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
meaning in the Parable of the Bird. For one day the Teacher
addressed the monks: “Walk, monks, in lawful ground, in the
region of the fathers.” Then he said: “You just stay where you
belong. In former times even animals, because they left their
own ancestral region and walked in forbidden ground, fell into
the hands of their enemies, but through their own intelligence
and resourcefulness escaped from the hands of their enemies.”
So saying, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at
Benāres, the Future Buddha was reborn as a quail,
and made his home in a field of clods, turned up by
the plow. One day he said to himself: “I will seek
food in a foreign region.” So he left off seeking food
in his own region and went to the edge of a wood.
Now while he was picking up food there, a hawk saw
him and attacked him with violence and caught him.
As the hawk was carrying off the quail, the quail
thus lamented: “I am indeed mighty unfortunate, I
possess very little merit,—I who walked in forbidden
ground, in a foreign region. If to-day I had
walked in my own ground, in the region of my
fathers, this hawk would certainly not have been
equal to coming to a combat with me.”</p>

<p>“But, quail, what is your feeding-ground? What
is the region of your fathers?”</p>

<p>“A field of clods, turned up by the plow.”</p>

<p>Then the hawk, not exerting his strength, released
him. “Go, quail! Even there you will not escape.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
The quail went there, and mounting a big clod,
stood and cried to the hawk: “Come now, hawk!”</p>

<p>The hawk, exerting his strength, flapped both his
wings and attacked the quail with violence. But
when the quail knew: “This hawk is coming for me
with a vengeance!” he turned and entered a crack in
that very clod. The hawk, unable to check his speed,
struck his breast against that very clod. Thus the
hawk, with heart broken and eyes bulging out, met
destruction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Teacher had related this Story of the Past, he
said: “Thus, monks, even animals, when they walk in forbidden
ground, fall into the hands of their adversaries; but
when they walk in their own ground, in the region of their
fathers, they humble their adversaries. Therefore you also
must not walk in forbidden ground, in a foreign region. If,
monks, you walk in forbidden ground, in a foreign region, the
Evil One will obtain entrance, the Evil One will obtain lodgment.
If, monks, you walk in lawful ground, in the region of
the fathers, the Evil One will not obtain entrance, the Evil One
will not obtain lodgment.” Then, revealing his omniscience, he
uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A hawk flying strong, attacked with violence</div>
<div class="verse">A quail standing in his feeding-ground, and thus met death.</div>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now when the hawk had thus met his death, the
quail came out and exclaimed: “I have seen the back
of my enemy!” And standing on his heart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
breathing forth a solemn utterance, the quail uttered
the second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Endowed with sense, delighting in my own feeding-ground,</div>
<div class="verse">My enemy gone, I rejoice, intent on my own good.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Teacher, having proclaimed the Truths by the narration
of this fable, identified the personages in the Birth-story as
follows: “At that time the hawk was Devadatta, but the quail
was I myself.”</p>

<h3><i>A. Boy and mosquito.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Jātaka 44: i. 246-248.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Better an enemy.</i> This parable was related by the Teacher
while he was journeying from place to place in the country of
the Magadhas, in a certain little village, with reference to some
foolish villagers.</p>

<p>The story goes that once upon a time the Teacher went from
Sāvatthi to the kingdom of Magadha, and journeying about
from place to place in that kingdom, arrived at a certain little
village. Now that village was inhabited for the most part by
men who were utter fools. There one day those utter fools of
men assembled and took counsel together, saying: “Folks,
when we enter the forest and do our work, the mosquitoes eat
us up, and because of this our work is interrupted. Let us,
every one, take bows and weapons, go and fight with the
mosquitoes, pierce and cut all the mosquitoes, and thus make
way with them.” They went to the forest with the thought in
their minds, “We’ll pierce the mosquitoes.” But they pierced
and hit one another and came to grief, and on their return, lay
down within the boundaries of the village, in the village-square,
and at the village-gate.</p>

<p>The Teacher, surrounded by the Congregation of Monks,
entered that village for alms. The rest of the inhabitants, being
wise men, seeing the Exalted One, erected a pavilion at the
village-gate, gave abundant alms to the Congregation of Monks
presided over by the Buddha, saluted the Teacher, and sat
down. The Teacher, seeing wounded men lying here and there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
asked those lay disciples: “Here are many men who are in a
bad way. What have they done?” “Reverend Sir, these men
started out with the thought in their minds, ‘We’ll have a fight
with the mosquitoes.’ But they pierced one another and returned
themselves the worse for wear.” Said the Teacher: “Not
only in their present state of existence have utter fools of men,
with the thought in their minds, ‘We’ll hit mosquitoes,’ hit
themselves; in a previous state of existence also they were the
very men who, with the thought in their minds, ‘We’ll hit a
mosquito,’ hit something very different.” Then, in response to
a request of those men, he related the following Story of the
Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha made his living by trading. At
that time, in the kingdom of Kāsi, in a certain
frontier village, dwelt many carpenters. There a
certain grey-haired carpenter was planing a tree.
Now a mosquito settled on his head,—his head
looked like the surface of a copper bowl!—and
pierced his head with his stinger, just as though he
were sticking him with a spear. Said he to his son
who sat beside him: “Son, a mosquito is stinging me
on the head,—it feels just as if he were sticking me
with a spear! Shoo him away!” “Father, wait a
moment! I’ll kill him with a single blow!”</p>

<p>At that time the Future Buddha also, seeking
wares for himself, having reached that village, was
sitting in that carpenter’s hut. Well, that carpenter
said to his son: “Shoo this mosquito off!” “I’ll shoo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
him off, father!” replied the son. Taking his stand
immediately behind his father, the son, with the
thought in his mind, “I’ll hit the mosquito!” raised
aloft a big, sharp axe, and split the skull of his
father in two. The carpenter died on the spot. The
Future Buddha, seeing what the son had done,
thought: “Even an enemy, if he be a wise man, is
better; for an enemy, though it be from fear of
human vengeance, will not kill.” And he uttered the
following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Better an enemy with sense</div>
<div class="verse">Than a friend without it,</div>
<div class="verse">For with the words, “I’ll kill a mosquito!”</div>
<div class="verse">A son,—both deaf and dumb!—</div>
<div class="verse">Split his father’s skull!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Having uttered this stanza, the Future Buddha
arose and passed away according to his deeds. As for
the carpenter, his kinsfolk did their duty by his
body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Said the Teacher: “Thus, lay disciples, in a previous state
of existence also they were the very men who, with the thought
in their minds, ‘We’ll hit a mosquito,’ hit something very different.”
Having related this parable, he joined the connection
and identified the personages in the Birth-story as follows:
“But the wise man who uttered the stanza and departed on that
occasion was I myself.”</p>

<p class="center">Jātaka 45: i. 248-249.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Better an enemy.</i> This parable was related by the Teacher
while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a
certain slave-girl.</p>

<p>A certain wealthy merchant, we are told, had a slave-girl.
Where she was pounding rice, her old mother came in and lay
down. Flies buzzed round her and ate her up, just as though
they were piercing her with needles. She said to her daughter:
“My dear, the flies are eating me up. Shoo them off!” “I’ll
shoo them off!” replied the daughter. Raising her pestle aloft,
intending to kill the flies, with the thought in her mind, “I’ll
make way with them!” she struck her mother with the pestle
and killed her. When she saw what she had done, she began
to weep: “Mother! Mother!”</p>

<p>They reported that incident to the merchant. The merchant
had her body attended to, and went to the monastery and reported
the whole incident to the Teacher. Said the Teacher:
“Verily, householder, not only in her present state of existence
has this girl, with the thought in her mind, ‘I’ll kill the flies on
my mother’s head!’ struck her mother with a pestle and killed
her; in a previous state of existence also she killed her mother
in the very same way.” And in response to the merchant’s
request, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at
Benāres, the Future Buddha was reborn in a merchant’s
household, and on the death of his father,
succeeded to the post of merchant. He also had a
slave-girl. She also, when her mother came to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
place where she was pounding rice and said to her,
“My dear, shoo the flies away from me!”—she also,
in the very same way, struck her mother with a
pestle and killed her and began to weep. The Future
Buddha, hearing of that incident, thought: “For
even an enemy in this world, if only he be a wise
man, is better!” And he uttered the following
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Better an enemy who is intelligent</div>
<div class="verse">Than a well-disposed person who is a fool!</div>
<div class="verse">Look at that wretched little slave-girl!</div>
<div class="verse">She killed her mother, and now,—she weeps!</div>
</div></div>

<p>With this stanza did the Future Buddha preach
the Doctrine, praising the man of wisdom.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Said the Teacher: “Verily, householder, not only in her
present state of existence has this girl, with the thought in her
mind, ‘I’ll kill flies!’ caused the death of her mother; in a
previous state of existence also she caused the death of her
mother in the very same way.” Having related this parable,
he joined the connection and identified the personages in the
Birth-story as follows: “At that time that very mother was
the mother, that very daughter was the daughter, but the
wealthy merchant was I myself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Never, in the hands of one who knows not what is good.</i> This
parable was related by the Teacher in a certain little village
in the country of the Kosalas with reference to one who spoiled
a garden.</p>

<p>The story goes that the Teacher, while journeying from
place to place in the country of the Kosalas, arrived at a
certain little village. There a certain householder invited the
Teacher, provided seats in his garden, gave alms to the Congregation
of Monks presided over by the Buddha, and said:
“Reverend Sirs, walk about in this garden according to your
pleasure.”</p>

<p>The monks arose, and accompanied by the gardener, walked
about the garden. Seeing a certain bare spot, they asked the
gardener: “Disciple, everywhere else this garden has dense
shade, but in this spot there is not so much as a tree or a shrub.
What, pray, is the reason for this?” “Reverend Sirs, when this
garden was planted, a certain village boy watered it. In this
spot he pulled up the young trees by the roots, and according
as the roots were large or small, watered them plentifully or
sparingly. Those young trees withered and died. That’s how
this spot comes to be so bare!”</p>

<p>The monks approached the Teacher and reported that
matter to him. Said the Teacher: “Not only in his present state
of existence has that village boy spoiled a garden; in a previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
state of existence also he did naught but spoil a garden.”
So saying, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
a holiday was proclaimed. From the moment they
heard the holiday drum, the residents of the entire
city went about making holiday.</p>

<p>At that time many monkeys lived in the king’s
garden. The gardener thought: “A holiday has been
proclaimed in the city. I’ll tell these monkeys to
water the garden, and then I’ll go make holiday.”
Approaching the leader of the monkeys, he said:
“Master monkey-leader, this garden is of great use
even to you. Here you eat flowers and fruits and
shoots. A holiday has been proclaimed in the city.
I’m going to make holiday.” And he asked him the
question: “Can you water the young trees in this
garden until I come back?” “Yes, indeed, I’ll water
them.” “Very well,” said the gardener; “be heedful.”
So saying, he gave those monkeys water-skins
and wooden water-pots to use in watering the trees,
and departed. The monkeys took the water-skins
and wooden water-pots and watered the young
trees.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_130a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_130a.jpg" alt="When you water the young trees, pull them up by the

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“<i>When you water the young trees, pull them up by the
roots, every one.</i>”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now the leader of the monkeys said to the monkeys:
“Master-monkeys, the water must not be
wasted. When you water the young trees, pull them
up by the roots, every one; look at the roots; water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>plentifully the roots that strike deep, but sparingly
the roots that do not strike deep; later on we shall
have a hard time getting water.” “Very well,” said
the monkeys, promising to do as he told them to.
And they did so.</p>

<p>At that time a certain wise man saw those monkeys
working away in the king’s garden, and said
to them: “Master-monkeys, why are you pulling up
by the roots every one of those young trees and
watering them plentifully or sparingly according
as the roots are large or small?” The monkeys
replied: “That’s what the monkey who is our leader
told us to do.” When the wise man heard that reply,
he thought: “Alas! alas! Those that are fools, those
that lack wisdom, say to themselves: ‘We’ll do
good.’ But harm’s the only thing they do!” And he
uttered the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Never, in the hands of one who knows not what is good,</div>
<div class="verse">Does a good undertaking turn out happily.</div>
<div class="verse">A man who lacks intelligence spoils what is good</div>
<div class="verse">Like the monkey who worked in the garden.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, with this stanza, did that wise man censure
the leader of the monkeys. Having so done, he departed
from the garden with his followers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Said the Teacher: “Not only in his present state of existence
has that village boy spoiled a garden; in a previous state of
existence also he did naught but spoil a garden.” Having related<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
this parable, he joined the connection and identified the personages
in the Birth-story as follows: “At that time the leader

the wise man was I myself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If the monkey considered the best of the crowd.</i> This parable
was related by the Teacher in the South Mountain region with
reference to a certain gardener’s son.</p>

<p>The story goes that the Teacher, after keeping residence
for the period of the rains, departed from Jetavana and
journeyed from place to place in the South Mountain region.
Now a certain lay disciple invited the Congregation of Monks
presided over by the Buddha, provided seats in his garden,
delighted them with rice-gruel and hard food, and said: “Noble
sirs, if you desire to take a walk about the garden, go with this
gardener.” And he gave orders to the gardener: “Pray give the
noble monks fruits and other such-like edibles.”</p>

<p>As the monks walked about, they saw a certain cleared
space, and asked: “This space is cleared, without growing
trees; what, pray, is the reason for this?” Then the gardener
told them: “The story goes that a certain gardener’s son once
watered the saplings. ‘I’ll water them plentifully or sparingly
according as the roots are large or small,’ thought he. So he
pulled them up by the roots and watered them plentifully or
sparingly according as the roots were large or small. That’s
how this space comes to be cleared!”</p>

<p>The monks went to the Teacher and reported that matter
to him. Said the Teacher: “Not only in his present state of
existence has that youth spoiled a garden; in a previous state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of existence also he did naught but spoil a garden.” So saying,
he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, when Vissasena ruled at Benāres,
a holiday was proclaimed. Thought the gardener:
“I’ll go make holiday;” and said to the monkeys who
lived in the garden: “This garden is of great use to
you. I’m going to make holiday for seven days.
You must water the saplings on the seventh day.”
“Very well,” said they, consenting. He gave them
little water-skins and departed.</p>

<p>The monkeys did as they were told and watered
the saplings. Now the leader of the monkeys said to
the monkeys: “Wait a moment! Water is at all
times hard to get; it must not be wasted. What you
must do is to pull up the saplings by the roots, note
the length of the roots, water plentifully the saplings
that have long roots, but sparingly those that
have short roots.” “Very well,” said the monkeys,
and went about watering the saplings, some of them
pulling the saplings up by the roots and others
planting them again.</p>

<p>At that time the Future Buddha was the son of a
certain notable in Benāres. Having occasion, for
some purpose or other, to go to the garden, he saw
those monkeys working away, and asked them:
“Who told you to do this?” “The monkey who is our
leader.” “Well! if this is the wisdom of your leader,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
what must yours be like!” And explaining the
matter, he uttered the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If the monkey considered the best of the crowd</div>
<div class="verse">Has wisdom like this,</div>
<div class="verse">Then what in the world must the others be like?</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hearing this remark, the monkeys uttered the
second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Brahman, you don’t know what you are talking about</div>
<div class="verse">When you blame us like this;</div>
<div class="verse">For how, unless we see the roots,</div>
<div class="verse">Can we know whether the tree stands firm?</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hearing their reply, the Future Buddha uttered
the third stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">It isn’t you I blame,—not I,—</div>
<div class="verse">Nor the other monkeys in the wood;</div>
<div class="verse">Vissasena alone is the one to blame,</div>
<div class="verse">Who asked you to tend his trees for him.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Teacher had related this parable, he identified
the personages in the Birth-story as follows: “At that time
the leader of the monkeys was the youth who spoiled the
garden, but the wise man was I myself.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times two dicers played at dice. The first

<p class="center">Jātaka 91: i. 379-380.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a certain occasion the Exalted One reproved the monks for
handling their property carelessly. Said he: “Monks, careless
handling of property is like careless handling of deadly poison.
For men of old, through carelessness, not knowing what was
the matter, ate poison, and as a result experienced great suffering.”
So saying, he related the following Story of the Past:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres,
the Future Buddha was reborn in a household of
great wealth. When he reached manhood, he became
a dicer. Now a second dicer used to play with the
Future Buddha, and he was a cheat. So long as he
was winning, he would not break the play-ring; but
when he lost, he would put a die in his mouth, say,
“A die is lost!” break the play-ring, and make off.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha, knowing the reason for this,
said: “Let be! I shall find some way of dealing with
him.” So taking the dice to his own home, he painted
them with deadly poison and let them dry
thoroughly. Then, taking them with him, he went
to the second dicer’s and said: “Come, sir, let us play
at dice.” “Yes, sir,” said the second dicer, and
marked out the play-ring.</p>

<p>As the second dicer played with the Future
Buddha, he lost, and put a die in his month. Now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Future Buddha, seeing him do this, said: “Just
swallow! Later you will know what that is.” And
to rebuke him he recited the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Smeared with the strongest poison</div>
<div class="verse">Was the die the man swallowed, but knew it not.</div>
<div class="verse">Swallow, O swallow, wicked dicer!</div>
<div class="verse">Later it will taste bitter to you.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Even as the Future Buddha spoke, he swooned
from the effect of the poison, rolled his eyes, dropped
his shoulders, and fell. Said the Future Buddha:
“Now I must grant him his life.” So giving him an
emetic containing herbs, he made him vomit. Then,
giving him ghee, honey, and sugar to eat, he made
him well. Finally he admonished him: “Never do
such a thing again.” And having performed alms-giving
and the other works of merit, the Future
Buddha passed away according to his deeds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Teacher had completed this parable, he said:
“Monks, careless handling of property is like careless handling

myself.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>24. Two Caravan-Leaders.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Be prudent!</i></p>


<h3><i>A. Canonical version.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Dīgha ii. 342-346.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times a great caravan of a thousand carts
went from the eastern country to the western country.
Wherever it went, very quickly were consumed
grass, sticks, water, and pot-herbs. Now over that
caravan were two caravan-leaders, one over five
hundred carts, one over five hundred carts. And
to these caravan-leaders occurred the following
thought: “This is a great caravan of a thousand
carts. Wherever we go, very quickly are consumed
grass, sticks, water, and pot-herbs. Suppose we were
to divide this caravan into two caravans of five hundred
carts each!” They divided that caravan into
two caravans, one of five hundred carts, one of five
hundred carts. One caravan-leader only loaded his
carts with abundant grass and sticks and water, and
started his caravan forward.</p>

<p>Now when he had proceeded a journey of two or
three days, that caravan-leader saw coming in the
opposite direction in a chariot drawn by asses, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
black man with bloodshot eyes, with ungirt quiver,
wearing a garland of lilies, his garments wet, the
hair of his head wet, the wheels of his chariot
smeared with mud. Seeing, he said this: “Whence,
sir, do you come?” “From such-and-such a country.”
“Whither do you intend to go?” “To such-and-such
a country.” “Evidently, sir, farther on in the
wilderness a heavy rain has been in progress.”
“Yes, indeed, sir. Farther on in the wilderness a
heavy rain has been in progress. The roads are
drenched with water; abundant are grass and sticks
and water. Throw away, sir, the old grass, sticks,
and water; with lightly burdened carts go ever so
quickly; do not overburden the conveyances.”</p>

<p>Now that caravan-leader told his drivers what
that man had said, and gave orders as follows:
“Throw away the old grass, sticks, and water; with
lightly burdened carts start the caravan forward.”
“Yes, sir,” said those drivers to that caravan-leader.
And in obedience to his command they threw away
the old grass, sticks, and water, and with lightly
burdened carts started the caravan forward. Neither
in the first stage of the journey, nor in the second,
nor in the third, nor in the fourth, nor in the fifth,
nor in the sixth, nor in the seventh, did they see grass
or sticks or water; they all met destruction and
death. And all that were in that caravan, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
men or beasts, did that ogre, that demon, devour,
leaving only the bare bones.</p>

<p>When the second caravan-leader knew, “It is
now a long time since that caravan started out,” he
loaded his carts with abundant grass and sticks and
water, and started his caravan forward. Now when
he had proceeded a journey of two or three days,
this caravan-leader saw coming in the opposite direction
in a chariot drawn by asses, a black man with
bloodshot eyes, with ungirt quiver, wearing a garland
of lilies, his garments wet, the hair of his head
wet, the wheels of his chariot smeared with mud.
Seeing, he said this: “Whence, sir, do you come?”
“From such-and-such a country.” “Whither do you
intend to go?” “To such-and-such a country.” “Evidently,
sir, farther on in the wilderness a heavy rain
has been in progress.” “Yes, indeed, sir. Farther on
in the wilderness a heavy rain has been in progress.
The roads are drenched with water; abundant are
grass and sticks and water. Throw away, sir, the old
grass, sticks, and water; with lightly burdened carts
go ever so quickly; do not overburden the conveyances.”</p>

<p>Now that caravan-leader told his drivers what
that man had said, adding: “This man surely is no
friend of ours, no kinsman or blood-relative. How
can we trust him on our journey? On no account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
must the old grass, sticks, and water, be thrown
away. Start the caravan forward, leaving the things
just as they are. I will not permit you to throw away
the old.” “Yes, sir,” said those drivers to that caravan-leader.
And in obedience to his command they
started the caravan forward, leaving the things just
as they were. Neither in the first stage of the journey,
nor in the second, nor in the third, nor in the
fourth, nor in the fifth, nor in the sixth, nor in the
seventh, did they see grass or sticks or water; but
they saw that caravan in destruction and ruin. And
of those that were in that caravan, whether men or
beasts, they saw only the bare bones, for they had
been eaten by that ogre, by that demon.</p>

<p>Thereupon that caravan-leader addressed his
drivers: “This caravan here met destruction and
ruin solely through the folly of that foolish caravan-leader
who acted as its guide. Now then, throw away
those wares in our own caravan which are of little
worth, and take those wares in this other caravan
which are of great worth.” “Yes, sir,” said those
drivers to that caravan-leader. And in obedience to
his command they threw away all those wares in
their own caravan which were of little worth, and
took those wares in that other caravan which were
of great worth. And they passed in safety through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
that wilderness solely through the wisdom of that
wise caravan-leader who acted as their guide.</p>


<h3><i>B. Uncanonical version.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Jātaka 1: i. 95-106.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One day a wealthy merchant, accompanied by five hundred
disciples of heretical teachers, went to Jetavana monastery,
saluted the Exalted One, presented offerings, and sat down.
Likewise did those disciples of heretical teachers salute the
Teacher and sit down, close beside the merchant. And they
gazed at the countenance of the Teacher, resplendent with the
glory of the full moon; at his form, a form like that of Great
Brahmā, adorned with the greater and lesser marks of beauty,
encircled with a radiance a fathom deep; at the solid rays of
a Buddha which issued from his body, forming, as it were,
garland after garland and pair after pair.</p>

<p>And to them the Teacher, as it were a young lion roaring
the lion’s roar on a table-land in the Himālaya mountains, as
it were a cloud thundering in the rainy season, as it were
bringing down the Heavenly Ganges, as it were weaving a
rope of jewels, with a voice like that of Great Brahmā, endowed
with the Eight Excellences, captivating the ear, delighting the
heart, preached a pleasing discourse on the Doctrine, diversified
in divers ways.</p>

<p>The heretics, after listening to the discourse of the Teacher,
believed in their hearts, and rising from their seats, burst
asunder the refuge of the heretical teachers and sought refuge
in the Buddha. From that time on they regularly accompanied
the merchant to the monastery with offerings, listened to the
Doctrine, gave alms, kept the Precepts, observed Fast-day.
Now the Exalted One departed from Sāvatthi and went back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
again to Rājagaha. When the Teacher departed, the heretics
burst that refuge asunder, sought refuge once more in the
heretical teachers, lapsed once more into their former position.</p>

<p>When the Exalted One returned to Sāvatthi and learned
what had happened, he said to those backsliders: “Laymen, in
former times also men mistook for a refuge what was no refuge
at all, grasped with the grasp of reason, with the grasp of
contradiction, and in a wilderness haunted by demons came
to a sorry end, becoming the food of ogres. But men who laid
hold of Truth absolute, certain, consistent, obtained safety in
that very wilderness.” Having so said, he became silent.</p>

<p>Thereupon the merchant, rising from his seat, saluted and
applauded the Exalted One. And joining his hands and pressing
them to his head in token of reverent salutation, he spoke
as follows: “Reverend Sir, it is clear to us that these laymen
just now burst asunder the Supreme Refuge and chose instead
speculation. But the fact that in former times, in a wilderness
haunted by demons, men who chose speculation were destroyed,
while men who chose Absolute Truth were saved,—that
fact is hidden from us and clear to you alone. It were
indeed well were the Exalted One, as it were making the full
moon rise in the heavens, to make this fact clear to us.”</p>

<p>Then the Exalted One aroused the attention of the merchant
by saying: “I, O householder, fulfilled the Ten Perfections
during a period of time which cannot be measured, and penetrated
Omniscience, for the sole purpose of rending asunder
the doubt of the world. Lend ear and listen as attentively as
though you were filling a golden tube with lion-marrow.”
Thereupon, as it were cleaving the Vault of the Snow and releasing
the full moon, he revealed circumstances hidden by
rebirth:</p>
</div>

<p>In times past, in the kingdom of Kāsi, in the city
of Benāres, there was a king named Brahmadatta.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
At that time the Future Buddha was reborn in the
household of a caravan-leader. In the course of time
he grew to manhood, and went about trading with
five hundred carts. Sometimes he went from east
to west, sometimes from west to east. In the same
city of Benāres there was another caravan-leader
besides, a foolish, short-sighted, resourceless fellow.</p>

<p>At that time the Future Buddha took a valuable
lot of goods from Benāres, filled five hundred carts,
made preparations for the journey, and was all
ready to start. Likewise that foolish caravan-leader
also filled five hundred carts, made preparations for
the journey, and was all ready to start.</p>

<p>The Future Buddha thought: “If this foolish
caravan-leader goes at the same time I go, and a
thousand carts travel along the road together, even
the road will not be big enough. It will be difficult
for the men to find firewood and water, and difficult
for the oxen to find grass. Either he or I should go
first.” So he had the man summoned, told him the
situation, and said: “It is out of the question for
both of us to go at the same time. Will you go first,
or follow after?”</p>

<p>Thought the foolish caravan-leader: “There are
many advantages in my going first. There will not
be a single rut in the road over which I travel; my
oxen will eat grass which has not been touched; my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
men will have leaves for curry which have not been
touched; the water will be clear; I can sell my goods
at whatever price I choose to set.” So he said: “I,
sir, will go first.”</p>

<p>As for the Future Buddha, he saw many advantages
in going second, for the following considerations
presented themselves to his mind:
“Those who go first will make smooth the rough
spots on the road; I shall go by the same road they
have gone; the oxen that go first will eat the old
tough grass, and my oxen will eat the fresh grass
which will have sprung up in the meantime; wherever
they pluck leaves, fresh leaves for curry will
have sprung up and will be at the disposal of my
men; in places where there is no water, they will dig
wells and obtain a supply, and we shall drink water
from wells dug by others. Moreover, price-fixing is
like depriving men of life! If I go second, I can sell
my goods for whatever price they have fixed.”
Accordingly, seeing all these advantages in going
second, he said: “You, sir, go first.” “Very well,
sir,” said the foolish caravan-leader. So harnessing
his carts, he set out, and in due course passing beyond
the habitations of men, he reached the mouth of
the wilderness.</p>

<p>(Wildernesses are of five kinds: robber-wildernesses,
beast-wildernesses, waterless wildernesses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
demon-wildernesses, famine-wildernesses. Where
the road is infested with robbers, it is called a robber-wilderness.
Where the road is infested with lions and
other beasts of prey, it is called a beast-wilderness.
Where there is no water for bathing or drinking, it
is called a waterless wilderness. If it is infested with
demons, it is called a demon-wilderness. If it lacks
roots and hard food and soft food, it is called a
famine-wilderness. Of these five kinds of wildernesses,
this wilderness was both a waterless wilderness
and a demon-wilderness.)</p>

<p>Therefore that caravan-leader set many huge
chatties in the carts and had them filled with water
before he struck into the sixty-league wilderness.
Now when he reached the middle of the wilderness,
the ogre who lived in the wilderness, thinking, “I
will make these men throw away the water they
took,” created a car to delight the heart, drawn by
pure white young oxen; and surrounded by ten or
twelve demons bearing in their hands bow, quiver,
shield, and weapon, decked with water-lilies both
blue and white, head wet, garments wet, seated in
that car like a very lord, the wheels of the car
smeared with mud, came down that road from the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Both before him and behind him marched the
demons who formed his retinue, heads wet, garments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
wet, decked with garlands of water-lilies both
blue and white, carrying in their hands clusters of
lotus-flowers both red and white, chewing the fibrous
stalks of water-lilies, streaming with drops of water
and mud.</p>

<p>Now caravan-leaders, when the wind is ahead, to
avoid the dust, ride in front, sitting in their cars,
surrounded by their attendants. When it blows from
behind, they ride behind in precisely the same way.
But at this time the wind was ahead; therefore that
caravan-leader rode in front.</p>

<p>When the ogre saw him approaching, he caused
his own car to turn out of the road and greeted him in
a friendly manner, saying: “Where are you going?”
The caravan-leader also caused his own car to turn
out of the road, allowing room for the carts to pass,
and standing aside, said to that ogre: “We, sir, are
just approaching from Benāres. But you are approaching
decked with water-lilies both blue and
white, with lotus-flowers both red and white in your
hands, chewing the fibrous stalks of water-lilies,
smeared with mud, with drops of water streaming
from you. Is it raining along the road by which you
came? Are the lakes completely covered with water-lilies
both blue and white, and lotus-flowers both red
and white?”</p>

<p>When the ogre heard his words, he said: “Friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
what’s this you’re saying? Do you see that dark
green streak of woods? Beyond that point the entire
forest is one mass of water; it rains all the time; the
hollows are full of water; in this place and in that
are lakes completely covered with lotus-flowers both
red and white.” As the carts passed, one after
another, he inquired: “Where are you going with
these carts?” “To such-and-such a country.” “What
are the goods you have in this cart,—and in that?”
“Such-and-such.”</p>

<p>“The cart that approaches last moves as though it
were excessively heavy; what goods have you in
that?” “There is water in that.” “In bringing water
thus far, of course, you have acted wisely. But beyond
this point you have no occasion to carry water.
Ahead of you water is abundant. Break the chatties
to pieces, throw away the water, travel at ease.” And
having so said, he added: “You continue your
journey; we have some business that detains us.”
The ogre went a little way, and when he was out of
their sight, went back again to his own city of ogres.</p>

<p>Now that foolish caravan-leader, out of his own
foolishness, took the advice of the ogre, broke the
chatties to pieces, threw away all of the water, leaving
not so much as a dribble, and caused the carts to
move forward. Ahead there was not the slightest
particle of water. For lack of water to drink the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
men grew weary. They traveled until sundown, and
then unharnessed the carts, drew them up in a contracted
circle, and tied the oxen to the wheels. There
was neither water for the oxen nor gruel and boiled
rice for the men. The weakened men lay down here
and there and went to sleep. At midnight the ogres
approached from the city of ogres, slew both oxen
and men, every one, devoured their flesh, leaving
only the bare bones, and having so done, departed.
Thus, by reason of a single foolish caravan-leader,
they all met destruction. The bones of their hands
and all their other bones lay scattered about in the
four directions and the four intermediate directions;
five hundred carts stood as full as ever.</p>

<p>As for the Future Buddha, he waited for a month
and a half from the day when the foolish caravan-leader
set out, and then set out from the city with
five hundred carts. In due course he reached the
mouth of the wilderness. There he had the water-chatties
filled, putting in an abundant supply of
water. Then, sending a drum around the camp, he
assembled his men and spoke as follows: “Without
first obtaining my permission, you must not use so
much as a dribble of water. In the wilderness there
are poison-trees: any leaf or flower or fruit which
you have not previously eaten, you must not eat
without first obtaining my permission.” Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
thus admonished his men, he struck into the wilderness
with his five hundred carts.</p>

<p>When he reached the middle of the wilderness,
that ogre showed himself in the path of the Future
Buddha in precisely the same way as before. When
the Future Buddha saw him, he knew: “In this
wilderness is no water; that is what is called a
waterless wilderness. Moreover this fellow is fearless,
red-eyed, casts no shadow. Without a doubt this
fellow caused the foolish caravan-leader who went
first to throw away all his water, and having thus
brought weariness upon him and his company, devoured
them. But, unless I am mistaken, he does
not know how wise and resourceful I am.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the Future Buddha said to the ogre:
“You go your way. We are traders. Unless we see
water farther on, we shall not throw away the water
we have brought. But wherever we do see water,
there we shall throw away the water we have
brought, and having thus lightened our carts, shall
continue our journey.” The ogre went a little way,
and when he was out of sight, went back again to his
own city of ogres.</p>

<p>Now when the ogre had gone, the men asked the
Future Buddha: “Noble sir, these men said: ‘Do
you see that dark green streak of woods? Beyond
that point it rains all the time.’ And the men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
said it approached garlanded with garlands of
water-lilies both blue and white, carrying clusters of
lotus-flowers both red and white, chewing the
fibrous stalks of water-lilies, heads wet, garments
wet, with drops of water streaming from them. Let
us throw away the water and go quickly with
lightened carts.”</p>

<p>The Future Buddha, hearing their words, caused
the carts to halt, assembled all of his men, and asked:
“Has any one of you heard that there is either a
lake or a pool in this wilderness?” “Noble sir, we
have not so heard. This is what is called a waterless
wilderness.” “Just now some men said: ‘Beyond
that dark green streak of woods it is raining.’ Now
how far does a rain-wind blow?” “A matter of a
league, noble sir.” “But has a rain-wind touched the
body of even a single one of you?” “It has not, noble
sir.” “How far off is a cloud-head visible?” “A
matter of a league, noble sir.” “But has any one of
you seen even a single cloud-head?” “We have not,
noble sir.” “How far off is lightning visible?” “Four
or five leagues, noble sir.” “But has any one of you
seen a flash of lightning?” “We have not, noble sir.”
“How far off can the sound of a cloud be heard?”
“A matter of one or two leagues, noble sir.” “But
has any one of you heard the sound of a cloud?”
“We have not, noble sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Those are not human beings; those are ogres.
They must have come with the thought in their
minds: ‘We will make these men throw away their
water, weaken them, and devour them.’ The foolish
caravan-leader who went first was not resourceful.
Undoubtedly he must have thrown away the water
at their behest, grown weary, and been devoured;
the five hundred carts must stand as full as ever.
To-day we shall see them. Do not throw away even
so much as a dribble of water, but drive ahead as fast
as ever you can.” With these words he bade them
drive forward.</p>

<p>Proceeding, he saw the five hundred carts as full
as ever, and the bones of the men’s hands and all
their other bones scattered in all directions. He had
the carts unharnessed and a stockade built by drawing
them into a contracted circle. He had both men
and oxen given their supper betimes, and the oxen
lie down in the centre of the circle formed by the
men. He himself, assisted by the leaders of the force,
kept watch during the three watches of the night,
sword in hand, and allowed the dawn to rise upon
him standing there.</p>

<p>On the following day, very early in the morning,
he had his men do all their chores, feed the oxen,
discard the weak carts, substitute strong ones, throw
away goods of little value, substitute those of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
value. And going to the place where he would be,
he sold his goods for twice or thrice the price, and
together with his entire company went back again
to his own city.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Teacher had related this parable, he said: “Thus,
householder, in times past those who grasped with the grasp
of speculation came to a sorry end, but those who grasped
Absolute Truth escaped from the hands of demons, went in
safety to the place where they would be, and went back again
to their own place.” And having thus joined the two parts of
this Parable of Absolute Truth, he, the Supremely Enlightened,
uttered the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Some adhered to Absolute Truth, sophists to less than this.</div>
<div class="verse">Knowing this, a wise man should lay hold on Absolute Truth.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Said the Teacher in conclusion: “At that time the wise
caravan-leader was I myself.”</p>

<p class="ph3">“<i>Eat me, O lion!</i>”</p>

<p class="center">Adapted from C. H. Tawney, Ocean of the Streams of Story
(Kathāsaritsāgara), Chapter 72.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times past there dwelt in a cave in the Vindhya
mountains a wise boar, who was none other than the
Buddha in a previous state of existence, and with
him his friend a monkey. He was compassionate
towards all living beings. One day there came to his
cave a lion and a lioness and their cub. And the lion
said to his mate: “Since the rains have hindered the
movements of all living beings, we shall of a certainty
perish for lack of some animal to eat.” And
the lioness said: “Of a certainty one or another of us
is destined to die of hunger. Therefore do you and
the cub eat me, for thus you will save your lives! Are
you not my lord and master? Can you not get
another mate like me? Therefore do you and the cub
eat me, for thus you will save your lives!”</p>

<p>Now at that moment the wise boar awoke, and
hearing the words of the lioness, was delighted, and
thought to himself: “This is the fruit of the merit
which I have acquired in previous states of existence.
I will satisfy the hunger of my friends with my own
body and blood.” Then the wise boar arose from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
bed and went out of his cave and said to the lion:
“My good friend, do not despair. For here I am,
ready to be eaten by you and your mate and your
cub. Eat me, O lion!” Now when the lion heard these
words, he was delighted, and said to his mate: “Let
our cub eat first; then I will eat, and you shall eat
after me.” The lioness agreed.</p>

<p>So first the cub ate some of the flesh of the wise
boar, and then the lion began to eat. And while he
was eating, the wise boar said to him: “Be quick and
drink my blood before it sinks into the ground, and
satisfy your hunger with my flesh, and let your mate
eat what is left.” So the lion gradually devoured the
flesh until only the bones were left. But—wonderful
to relate!—the wise boar did not die, for his life
remained in him, as if to see how long his endurance
would endure. In the meantime the lioness died of
hunger in the cave, and the lion went off somewhere
or other with his cub, and so the night came to an
end.</p>

<p>Then the monkey awoke and went out of the cave,
and seeing the wise boar reduced to a heap of bones,
became greatly excited and exclaimed: “What reduced
you to a heap of bones? Tell me, O friend, if
you can.” So the wise boar told him the whole story.
Then the monkey did reverence to the wise boar, and
said to him: “Tell me what you wish me to do, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
I will do it.” The wise boar replied: “I wish only to
have my body restored to me like as it was before,
and to have the lioness that died of hunger restored
to life again, that she may satisfy her hunger with
my body and blood.” Thereupon, as the fruit of the
merit which the wise boar had acquired, he was transformed
into a sage, and the monkey into a sage likewise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>26. Fairy-Prince and Griffin.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">“<i>Eat me, O griffin!</i>”</p>

<p class="center">Adapted from C. H. Tawney, Ocean of the Streams of Story
(Kathāsaritsāgara), Chapters 22 and 90.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a ridge of the Himālaya stands a city called the
Golden City, for it gleams from afar like the rays of
the sun. And in that city, once upon a time, lived
the king of the fairies, and his name was Jīmūta-ketu.
And in the garden of his palace grew a wishing-tree,
and its name was Granter of Desires, for
it granted all desires. By the favor of that tree the
king obtained a son, who was none other than the
Future Buddha, and his name was Jīmūta-vāhana.
He was valiant in generosity, of mighty courage,
and compassionate towards all living beings.</p>

<p>When Jīmūta-vāhana was become of age, his
father made him crown-prince. Thus did he become
the fairy-prince. And when he had become the fairy-prince,
the ministers of the kingdom came to him
and said: “O fairy-prince, do reverence always to
this wishing-tree, for it grants all desires, and cannot
be resisted by any living creature. For so long as
we possess this tree, we cannot suffer injury of any
kind from anyone, even from Indra, king of the
gods, much less from any other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>When Jīmūta-vāhana heard these words, he
thought to himself: “Alas! our forefathers, for all
their possession of this noble tree, obtained by the
favor of this tree naught but wealth and victory over
their enemies; thus did they demean themselves, and
thus did they demean this tree likewise. For no such
purposes as these will I employ this tree. For I
know that the good things of this world endure but
for a short while, and then perish and vanish utterly.
But friendliness and compassion and generosity
towards all living beings yield abundant fruit, both
in this world and in the next. As for wealth, if it be
not used for the benefit of others, it is like lightning
which for an instant stings the eye, and then flickers
and vanishes. Therefore if this wishing-tree which
we possess, and which grants all desires, be employed
for the benefit of others, we shall reap from
it all the fruit that it can give. Accordingly I will so
act that by the wealth of this tree all living beings
shall be delivered from poverty and distress.”</p>

<p>Then Jīmūta-vāhana went to the wishing-tree
and said: “O tree-spirit, thou that dost grant to us
the fruit that we desire, fulfil to-day this one wish of
mine: Deliver all living beings from poverty and
distress.” Straightway—wonderful to relate!—the
wishing-tree showered a shower of gold upon the
earth, and all living beings rejoiced thereat and became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
well-disposed to Jīmūta-vāhana, and the fame
and glory of him spread both near and far. But the
relatives of Jīmūta-ketu, seeing that his throne was
firmly established by the glory of his son, were
moved to jealousy and became hostile to him. And
because the kingdom of Jīmūta-ketu was weak, they
determined to attack it and overthrow it, and to take
possession of the wishing-tree that granted all desires.
And they assembled and met together and
began preparations to attack the kingdom of
Jīmūta-ketu and to overthrow it and to take possession
of the wishing-tree that granted all desires.</p>

<p>Thereupon Jīmūta-vāhana the fairy-prince said
to Jīmūta-ketu the fairy-king his father: “Why
should we seek to obtain new wealth, or to retain the
wealth that we possess? Is not this body of ours like
a bubble in the water, which bursts in an instant and
vanishes? Is it not like a candle, which, when it is
exposed to the wind, flickers for an instant and goes
out? Should a wise man desire to obtain wealth or
to retain it when it is obtained, by the killing of
living beings? I will not fight with my relatives.
Therefore I will leave my kingdom and go to some
forest-hermitage. Let these miserable wretches do
as they like, but let us not kill the members of our
own family.”</p>

<p>And Jīmūta-ketu the fairy-king said to Jīmūta-vāhana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
the fairy-prince his son: “Then will I too go,
my son. For what desire for rule can I have, who am
old, when you, who are young, out of compassion
towards all living beings, abandon your kingdom as
though it were so much straw and stubble?” Thereupon
Jīmūta-vāhana, with his father and mother,
went to the Malaya mountain, and took up his abode
in a forest-hermitage, the dwelling of the fairy-magicians,
the Siddhas, where the brooks were
hidden by the sandalwood trees, and devoted himself
to the care of his father and mother.</p>

<p>One day, as he was roaming about with a companion,
he came to a wood on the shore of the sea.
There he saw many heaps of bones. And he said
to his companion: “Whose bones are these?” His
companion replied: “Give ear, and I will tell you
the story in a few words.”</p>

<h3><i>Griffin and snakes.</i></h3>

<p>In times past Kadrū and Vinatā, the two wives
of Kashyapa, had a quarrel. Kadrū said that the
horses of the Sun were black, and Vinatā said that
they were white, and they made a wager that whichever
of the two was wrong should become a slave of
the other. Then Kadrū, bent on winning, actually
induced her sons the snakes to defile the horses of
the Sun by spitting venom over them; and showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
them to Vinatā thus defiled, she conquered her by a
trick and made her her slave.</p>

<p>When the griffin, the son of Vinatā, heard of that,
he came and tried to induce Kadrū to release Vinatā
from slavery. Then the snakes, the sons of Kadrū,
said to the griffin, the son of Vinatā: “O griffin, the
gods have begun to churn the sea of milk. Fetch
thence the drink of immortality and give it to us as
a substitute, and then take your mother away with
you.” When the griffin heard these words, he went
to the sea of milk and displayed his mighty prowess
in order to obtain the drink of immortality. Then the
god Vishnu, pleased with his mighty prowess, condescended
to say to him: “I am pleased with thee;
choose some boon.” Then the griffin, angry because
his mother had been made a slave, asked the following
boon of Vishnu: “May the snakes become my
food!” Vishnu granted him this boon. Now Indra,
king of the gods, listened to the conversation, and
when the griffin, by his mighty prowess, had obtained
the drink of immortality, he said to him: “O
griffin, take steps to prevent the foolish snakes from
consuming the drink of immortality, and to enable
me to take it away from them again.” The griffin
agreed, and elated by the boon of Vishnu, he went
to the snakes with the vessel containing the drink of
immortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>And he called out from afar to the snakes: “To
you have I brought the drink of immortality. Take
it, and release my mother. But if you are afraid, I
will put it on a bed of darbha-grass. So soon as my
mother is released, I will go; therefore take the
drink of immortality thence.” Now the snakes were
terrified by reason of the boon which Vishnu had
granted to the griffin, and at once agreed to the
bargain. Then the griffin set on a bed of darbha-grass
the vessel containing the drink of immortality,
and the snakes released his mother from slavery, and
the griffin departed with her.</p>

<p>But while the snakes, not suspicious of a ruse,
were in the very act of taking the drink of immortality,
Indra, king of the gods, suddenly swooped
down, and confounding them with his mighty prowess,
carried off the vessel containing the drink of
immortality. Then the snakes in despair licked the
bed of darbha-grass with their tongues, thinking
that there might be so much as a drop of the drink
of immortality spilt thereon; whereupon—wonderful
to relate—their tongues became split, and they
became double-tongued for nothing.</p>

<p>Thus did the snakes fail to obtain the drink of
immortality. And straightway their enemy the
griffin, relying on the boon which he had obtained
from Vishnu, swooped down on them and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
devour them. And this he did again and again. And
he wrought such havoc among them that the snakes
in Pātāla were nigh unto death from sheer fright,
and their females miscarried, and the whole race of
the snakes was nigh unto utter destruction. Then
Vāsuki, king of the snakes, fearing that the whole
race of the snakes would be rooted out, begged the
griffin to relent, and made the following agreement
with him: “O king of birds, every day, on the hill
that rises out of the sand of the sea, I will send you
a single snake to eat. But you must not commit the
folly of entering Pātāla, for by destroying utterly
the whole race of the snakes, you will only defeat
your own purpose.” The griffin consented. So every
day, on the hill that rises out of the sand of the sea,
Vāsuki, king of the snakes, sends to the griffin, the
king of the birds, a single snake to eat. And the
griffin, the king of the birds, devours each day the
snake which Vāsuki, king of the birds, sends to him
to eat. These heaps of bones are the bones of the
snakes which the griffin has eaten, and which, gradually
accumulating, have come to look like the peak
of a mountain.</p>

<h3><i>Fairy-prince and griffin.</i></h3>

<p>When Jīmūta-vāhana, the fairy-prince, embodiment
of generosity and compassion towards all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
living beings, heard this story from the lips of his
companion, he was pricked to the heart. And he said
to his companion: “Of a truth, Vāsuki, king of the
snakes, is to be pitied, for that, like a coward, he
delivers with his own hand into the hands of his
most bitter enemy the snakes that are his subjects.
Since he has a thousand faces and a thousand
mouths, why can he not say with one of his mouths
to the griffin who is his enemy: ‘Eat me first, O
griffin!’” Then did the noble-hearted Jīmūta-vāhana
make the following Earnest Wish: “May I,
by the sacrifice of my own body and blood, obtain
Supreme Enlightenment!”</p>

<p>At that moment a servant summoned Jīmūta-vāhana’s
companion to return home, and Jīmūta-vāhana,
embodiment of generosity and compassion
towards all living beings, was left alone. And
Jīmūta-vāhana roamed about alone, intent on carrying
out the resolution which he had formed. And as
he roamed about, he heard afar off a piteous sound
of weeping. And drawing near, he beheld on a lofty
slab of rock a youth of handsome appearance
plunged in bitter grief. And by his side stood an
officer of some monarch, as if he had brought him
and left him there. And the youth was seeking to
persuade an old woman who was weeping, to cease
her weeping and return whence she had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>And Jīmūta-vāhana stood and listened, melted
with pity, eager to know who he might be, and she.
And the old woman, overwhelmed with the burden
of her grief, began to look again and again at the
youth, and to lament her misfortune in the following
words: “Alas, my son! thou that wast obtained by
me at the cost of a hundred bitter pangs! Alas, virtuous
youth! Alas, only scion of our family, where
shall I behold thee again? Bereft of thee, thy father
will be plunged into the darkness of sorrow, and will
not for long endure to live. That body of thine,
which would suffer even from the torch of the sun’s
rays,—how can it endure the agony of being devoured
by the griffin? How comes it that Fate and
the king of the snakes were able to discover thee, the
only son of ill-starred me, though the world of the
snakes is wide?” Thereupon the youth said:
“Mother, I am afflicted enough as it is. Why do you
afflict me more? Return to your home, I beg you.
This is my last reverence to you. The griffin will
soon be here.” When the old woman heard those
words, she cast her sorrowful eyes all around the
horizon, and cried aloud: “Alas, I am undone! Who
will deliver my son from death?”</p>

<p>Then Jīmūta-vāhana with joy and delight went
up to the old woman and said: “Mother, I will deliver
your son!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>When the old woman heard those words, she was
frightened and terrified, for she thought that the
griffin had come. And straightway she cried out:
“Eat me, O griffin! eat me!” Then said the youth
her son: “Mother, be not afraid, for this is no
griffin!” Then said Jīmūta-vāhana: “Mother, I am
the prince of the fairies, disguised in the garb of a
man. I am come to deliver your son from death. I
will give my own body and blood to the hungry
griffin. Therefore return to your home, and take
your son with you.” But the old woman said: “By
no means! for in a still higher sense you yourself
are my very own son, since you have shown such a
measure of compassion to me and my son at this
time.” Then said Jīmūta-vāhana: “I have formed a
resolution, and you must not defeat my purpose.”</p>

<p>Then said the youth: “O thou of great and noble
heart! I cannot consent to save my own body at the
cost of thine. Should a common stone be saved by
the sacrifice of a precious stone? The world is full
of those who, like myself, pity only themselves. But
few in number are those who entertain sentiments
of compassion for the whole world and for all the
living beings that are therein.” At that moment the
trees began to sway with the wind of the wings of
the griffin, and seemed to utter a cry of dissuasion.
And the sea, churned by the wind, seemed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
eyes of its bright-flashing jewels to be gazing in
wonder and astonishment at the greatness of his
courage and the depth of his compassion. Then came
the griffin, hiding the heavens with his outspread
wings. And swooping down, he smote the valiant
hero Jīmūta-vāhana with his beak, and gripping
him with his talons, carried him off from that slab
of rock; and soaring aloft, flew quickly with him to
a peak of the Malaya mountain, to eat him there.
And Jīmūta-vāhana’s crest-jewel was torn from his
head, and drops of blood fell from his body, as the
griffin carried him through the air. And while the
griffin was devouring his body and blood, he uttered
the following Earnest Wish: “May my body and
blood be offered thus in every state of my existence,
and may I not obtain rebirth in heaven or deliverance
from the round of existences if thereby I shall
be deprived of the opportunity of doing good to my
neighbor!”</p>

<p>But afterwards, through the finding of his crest-jewel,
his kinsfolk and friends effected his deliverance
from the power of the griffin, and a goddess
sprinkled him with a potion, whereupon he arose
more glorious than before, with all his limbs made
whole again. And the goddess said to him: “My son,
I am pleased with this sacrifice of thy body and
blood. Therefore I sprinkle thee king of the fairies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and thy reign shall endure for a cycle of time.”
Thereupon a rain of flowers fell from the sky, and
the drums of the gods resounded with approbation.
And the griffin repented of his evil deeds, and said:
“From this day henceforth I will not again eat
snakes. As for those which I have already eaten, let
them return to life again!” Then—wonderful to
relate!—all the snakes that he had previously eaten
returned to life again. Then Jīmūta-vāhana was
escorted to the Himālaya, and was sprinkled king
over all the kings of the fairies, and his reign endured
for a cycle of time.</p>
